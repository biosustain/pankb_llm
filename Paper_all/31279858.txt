Title: Population structure and pangenome analysis of Enterobacter bugandensis uncover the presence of bla(CTX-M-55), bla(NDM-5) and bla(IMI-1), along with sophisticated iron acquisition strategies
Abstract: Enterobacter bugandensis is a recently described species that has been largely associated with nosocomial infections. We report the genome of a non-clinical
E. bugandensis strain, which was integrated with publicly available genomes to study the pangenome and general population structure of
E. bugandensis . Core- and whole-genome multilocus sequence typing allowed the detection of five E. bugandensis
phylogroups (PG-A to E), which contain important antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants. We uncovered several extended-spectrum β-lactamases, including
bla CTX-M-55 and bla NDM-5 , present in an IncX replicon type plasmid, described here for the first time in
E. bugandensis . Genetic context analysis of bla NDM-5 revealed the resemblance of this plasmid with other IncX plasmids from other bacteria from the same country. Three distinctive siderophore producing operons were found in
E. bugandensis : ent erobactin ( ent ), aerobactin ( iuc / iut ), and salmochelin ( iro ). Our findings provide novel insights on the lifestyle, physiology, antimicrobial, and virulence profiles of
E. bugandensis . Introduction Enterobacter bugandensis is a rod-shaped and Gram-negative pathogen that was first isolated from blood samples and powdered milk in a neonatal ward of the Bugando Medical Centre (Mwanza, Tanzania) [ 1 ]. Carrying a plasmid-borne bla CTX-M-15 , the lethal EB-247 strain had its genome sequenced, which was the first finished E. bugandensis genome (GCF_900324475.1) [ 2 , 3 ]. Urbaniak et al. [ 4 ] later reported the complete genome sequencing of several E. bugandensis isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, all these ISS strains showed resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, rifampin, and tobramycin, imposing health risks to ISS crew [ 4 ].
The massive and often inadequate use of antibiotics have been accelerating the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide [ 5 ]. Reports of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacter isolates are on the rise and already reached an emergency level [ 6 ], mainly because of the spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases [ 7 ].
The increasing availability of genomic data makes in silico AMR genotyping a promising strategy in research, surveillance, and clinical decisions [ 8 , 9 ]. Several authors reported the concordance between genotype and phenotype tests, supporting the use of genomic information in hospitals [ 10 , 11 ]. In a recent work, Chavda et al. conducted a phylogenomic analysis of Enterobacter spp. isolates, revealing the distribution of carbapenem resistance genes (e.g. bla KPC-2 , bla KPC-3 , bla KPC-4 , and bla NDM- 1 ) in the genus [ 12 ]. Because of the recent nosocomial outbreaks associated with MDR Enterobacter strains [ 13 ], new surveillance strategies using high-resolution molecular typing can be employed to determine the population structure and help in epidemiological investigations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-by-gene (GBG) approaches have been largely used for bacterial sub-typing [ 14 ]. Since SNPs are highly informative markers, their identification in a set of genes conserved across strains (e.g. core genome) is instrumental in revealing evolutionary histories of closely related bacteria [ 15 ]. The GBG strategy is based on inference of categorical data of allelic variation from a set of genes [ 16 ], commonly the core genome or even the whole genome [ 17 ].
In this work, we report the whole-genome sequencing and analysis of a non-clinical E. bugandensis strain isolated from cattle manure vermicompost. Through comparative analysis, SNP-based and GBG phylogenetic reconstructions, we reclassified nine published Enterobacter spp. genomes as E. bugandensis. We analyzed the E. bugandensis UENF-21GII genome along with those of publicly available E. bugandensis isolates, which allowed us to perform a comprehensive characterization of the genomic content, population structure, virulence, and resistance profiles in this species.
Results and discussion Isolation and genome sequencing of a non-clinical E. bugandensis strain During the characterization of culturable bacteria from mature cattle vermicompost, we identified a bacterium that was preliminarily characterized as Enterobacter sp. by colony morphology, microscopy, and 16S rRNA sequencing. This isolate was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (paired-end mode, 2 × 100 bp reads). Sequencing reads were processed with Trimmomatic [ 18 ], assembled using SPAdes [ 19 ], and annotated with PGAP [ 20 ] (see methods for details). The assembled genome has 17 scaffolds, encompassing 4,765,459 bp, with a GC content of 55.88%. The genome has 4539 coding sequences (CDS), 72 tRNA and 11 rRNA genes (Table S1). No plasmids were detected. We used BUSCO [ 21 ] to estimate genome completeness and recovered the full set of 781 Enterobacteriales single-copy genes, supporting the high quality and completeness of the assembled genome. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) [ 22 ] and digital DNA-DNA hybridization [ 23 ] revealed that this strain belongs to the E. bugandensis species (Table S2), leading us to name it as E. bugandensis UENF-21GII (accession GCF_004801095.1).
E. bugandensis pangenome determination Recent works have improved the taxonomic classification of Enterobacter spp. [ 24 ]. We used the ANI metric to inspect all Enterobacter genome assemblies available in Genbank ( n = 1616, January 2019) for potentially misclassified genomes (see methods for details). This is an important step that is in line with the recent announcement that NCBI will use a similar strategy in a large scale [ 25 ]. This analysis allowed us to reclassify five E. cloacae and four Enterobacter spp. as E. bugandensis , including E. cloacae MBRL 1077 (GCA_001562175), originally reported as the first IMI carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant E. cloacae strain isolated in the USA [ 26 ]. Our findings support the recent report from Singh et al. regarding the reclassification of this strain [ 27 ].
Next, we conducted a comparative genome analysis of 39 E. bugandensis genomes ( Table 1 ). Among the reclassified isolates, two have the same strain name as other E. bugandensis : IF2SW-B1* and IF2SW-P2* (GCA_001743375 and GCA_001743385, respectively). We used asterisks to differentiate these isolates from those previously classified as E. bugandensis IF2SW-B1 and IF2SW-P2 (GCA_002890755 and GCA_002890725, respectively). Although biased towards clinical and human-associated isolates, non-clinical E. bugandensis strains have been described here and elsewhere [ 28 ], implying that this species occupies a wider range of niches. We used the strains listed above ( Table 1 ) to build the E. bugandensis pangenome. Our results support a high genetic diversity and an open pangenome ( Fig. 1 a ), features that are often associated with the ability to colonize multiple environments [ 29 ]. The E. bugandensis pangenome is composed by 11,682 genes families: 3167 are common to all strains (core genome); 3785 are present in more than one (but not all) strains (accessory genome); 4730 are unique to any given strain ( Fig. 1 b).
E. bugandensis UENF-21GII has 362 unique genes, including two genes (EAI35_15025 and EAI35_02745) encoding S-type family pyocin-S domain proteins (a bacteriocin) that appear along with their immunity counterparts (EAI35_15020 and EAI35_02750) [ 30 , 31 ]. These pyocin-S proteins also have the PAAR_CT_2 [ 32 ] and the HNH endonuclease domain [ 30 , 33 ]. These toxins induce cell death by DNA cleavage and are commonly associated with niche competition in Pseudomonas [ 34 ]. Further, we found 27 genomic islands (GIs) in E. bugandensis UENF-21GII genome (Table S3), which probably represent recent horizontal gene transfer events. Two GIs (GI1 and GI2) are composed exclusively by unique genes. GI1 has 4305 bp, encompassing seven genes, mainly of unknown function, while GI2 has 9148 bp, comprising ten genes related to type 1 fimbrial assembly. Type 1 fimbriae are filamentous surface organelles that mediate bacterial adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces [ 35 ]. Interestingly, E. bugandensis UENF-21GII possesses several other genes related to type 1 fimbrial assembly along its core and accessory genomes, suggesting that this unique horizontally-acquired fimbrial operon might play specific roles in this strain. Further, the GI4 comprises curli specific genes (csg) [ 36 ] in two divergently transcribed operons (EAI35_03890 to EAI35_03915) downstream of csgG (EAI35_03885), which have been linked to host cell adhesion, invasion, and biofilm integrity [ 37 ]. Further, the presence of csg in the core genome supports curli biofilm assembly as a common virulence strategy in E. bugandensis , as reported in other Enterobacteriaceae (reviewed by [ 38 ]). Other GIs in E. bugandensis UENF-21GII include multiple operons encoding toxin-antitoxin systems and other proteins involved biological conflicts (Table S3). Collectively, these GIs indicate that E. bugandensis UENF-21GII is equipped with several horizontally-acquired genes that might be adaptive in highly competitive niches.
We also evaluated the composition of genetic mobile elements in E. bugandensis by searching for plasmids and bacteriophage signatures, as these elements can be associated with the emergence of new phenotypic traits. The most frequent bacteriophage was the lambdoid Enterobacteria phage mEp237 (NC_019704), present in 56.41% of the genomes used in this study, and duplicated in four genomes: ECC2572, MBRL1077, WCHEB090029, and WCHEB090283 (Table S4). The high prevalence of mEp237 suggests a role of this bacteriophage in the evolution and diversification of E. bugandensis . Regarding the distribution of plasmids, 33.33% of E. bugandensis strains had detectable replicon types, including IncX3, IncFII, IncFIA, IncFIB, and Col, being the former the most frequent replicon type (Table S5). Importantly, IncF plasmids are frequently associated with the dissemination of ESBLs, quinolone, and aminoglycoside resistance genes [ 39 ].
Molecular subtyping of E. bugandensis Although serological approaches are a gold standard in bacterial strain typing, such methods sometimes fail in predicting genomic relatedness [ 40 ]. Over the past decade, core- and whole-genome multilocus sequencing typing (cgMLST and wgMLST, respectively) have received considerable attention in bacterial epidemiology [ 17 , 41 ]. We applied both these methods to analyze the population structure of E. bugandensis . We used 311,598 SNPs extracted from the 3167 core genes to perform a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction (i.e. cgMLST; Fig. 2 ) to analyze the general population structure of E. bugandensis . We recovered five distinct phylogroups (PGs) with high statistical support. Nevertheless, several strains (e.g. E. bugandensis UENF-21GII) were not assigned to any PG, indicating that additional groups will be detected when a more diverse collection of E. bugandensis genomes become available. An expanded investigation of the E. bugandensis population structure using GBG wg and cgMLST dendrograms (Fig. S1 and S2, respectively) also supported the clustering patterns observed above, with the exception of the PG-C group. The slight incongruences between GBG- and SNP-based approaches are not surprising given the nature and assumptions of these methods. The long branch length of MBRL 1077 in the SNP cgMLST phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 2 ) supports this strain as a representative isolate of PG-C, which is poorly represented among publicly available genomes.
PG-A is the largest PG and comprises only isolates from the ISS surveillance initiative [ 4 ], supporting a common origin of these strains. The PG-E group comprises the environmental isolate from India (II-BT 08), along with clinical isolates from China (prefix WCHEB) and U.S. (prefix UMB). This heterogeneous group highlights the worldwide dissemination and diverse lifestyle of E. bugandensis . The admixture between environmental and clinical samples will be better understood when more genomes are sequenced. In a recent work, Singh et al. [ 27 ] stated, based on whole genome alignments, that ISS isolates formed a unique ecotype along with the type strain EB-247, 153_ECLO and MRBL 1077. Here, we performed a broader phylogenetic reconstruction of E. bugandensis , revealing that ISS and clinical isolates do not belong to the same PG. In addition, our analysis confirms the outgroup behavior of MBRL 1077 strain.
Distribution of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes The distribution of AMR and virulence genes across E. bugandensis strains remain poorly understood. We have further analyzed the E. bugandensis core genome to identify the core resistome and core virulome. A total of 96 and 52 core resistance and virulence genes were found, respectively (Table S6 and S7). We mapped these genes using the E. bugandensis UENF-21GII genome as reference ( Fig. 3 ). The presence of the enterobactin operon entABCDEFS , flanked by fep genes, implies that iron uptake via siderophore production [ 42 ] is ess ent ial in E. bugandensis . Also related to iron acquisition, the operon iucABCD / iutA is present in the E. bugandensis core virulome. This operon encodes the aerobactin system, which plays key roles during intracellular growth [ 43 ]. Pati et al. (2018) identified 141 up-regulated genes in E. bugandensis EB-247 (GCF_900324475.1) cultured in the presence of human blood serum [ 2 ]. This gene set includes genes encoding different iron acquisition systems, such as enterobactin ( ent ) and aerobactin ( iuc ) [ 2 ]. The presence of these genes in the core virulome demonstrates the importance of iron chelation in E. bugandensis virulence.
The core resistome is composed of a large number of efflux pumps (e.g. OqxAB, RosAB, AcrAB-TolC), which seems to be the main intrinsic resistance mechanism of E. bugandensis (Table S6). Further, we found that ACT-29 is the chromosomal constitutive intrinsic AmpC β-lactamase in E. bugandensis ; ACT-29 is typically associated with resistance against cephamycin, cephalosporin, penam, and carbapenem [ 44 ]. Other core genes were predicted to confer resistance against aminocoumarin, aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides (Table S6). In addition to genes that are directly involved with AMR, we also identified global metabolic regulators (e.g. H-NS, BaeRS, and marA) that modulate the transcription of an array of AMR genes [ 45 , 46 ]. In Enterobacteriaceae, the histone-like protein H-NS binds to AT-rich promoter regions, preferentially silencing horizontally-transferred genes [ 47 ]. H-NS has been shown to modulate virulence [ 48 ], motility [ 49 ], capsule biosynthesis [ 50 ], and expression of MDR efflux pumps [ 51 ].
Next, we screened the content of accessory and unique genomes. To illustrate the gene presence/absence profile of each strain, we mapped the resistance genes on the SNP-cgMLST tree ( Fig. 4 ). Many acquired resistance genes potentially confer resistance to quinolones ( qnr B17), aminoglycosides ( aadA ), fosfomycin ( fosA ), and macrolides ( srmB ) in E. bugandensis (Table S8). The bla IMI-1 carbapenemase gene was found in two strains (50588862 and MBRL 1077). In addition, we report for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-5 ( bla NDM-5 ) co-occurring with bla CTX-M-55 in E. bugandensis (strain WCHEB090029; Fig. 4 ).
The bla NDM-5 gene encodes one of the most clinically-relevant carbapenemases and has been previously reported within IncX plasmids in Escherichia coli [ 52 ]. The protein encoded by bla NDM-5 differs by only two amino acids from that encoded by bla NDM-1 (Val88Leu and Met154Leu) [ 53 , 54 ] and confers a broad-spectrum hydrolytic activity against penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems (except monobactams) [ 55 ]. In an elegant study, Ali et al. (2018) showed that the hydrolytic activity of NDM-5 is stronger than that of NDM-1, -4, -6 and -7, exhibiting a four-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem and meropenem when compared to NDM-1 [ 56 ]. Further, through molecular docking, Ali et al. proposed that NDM-5 is the only variant capable of creating a stable interaction with imipenem and meropenem. Plasmids from a variety of incompatibility groups have been reported to carry bla NDM-5 , typically along with several other AMR genes [ 57 ]. IncX3 plasmids were involved with bla NDM dispersion in Enterobacteriaceae in China [ 58 ] and South Korea [ 59 ].
Genetic context analysis of bla NDM-5 in the IncX3 plasmid of WCHEB090029 showed that this gene belongs to a 11,815 bp operon ( umu D-IS26- dsb D- trp F- ble - bla NDM-5 -IS5-ISAba125-IS3000) that is flanked by two transposases (ISKox3 and Tn2). This operon exhibits the same architecture found in four other IncX3 plasmids from other Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in China [ 60 ]. The identification of this plasmid in E. bugandensis , together with the presence of this species in several niches, indicates that the spread of plasmid-associated bla NDM-5 to other species constitutes a real risk that warrants further surveillance.
The E. bugandensis acquired virulome (Table S9) shows that the PG-A, composed only by ISS isolates ( Fig. 2 ), possesses extra capsule production genes (i.e. kvg AS) ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, we also noticed the presence of the iron transport operon iro BCDEN across eleven (28.2%) strains. Originally identified in Salmonella , this C-glucosylated form of enterobactin was termed salmochelin, and is often found in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) [ 61 ]. Salmochelins are more efficient than enterobactins in promoting bacterial growth [ 62 ], suggesting that they might confer a competitive advantage to iro -harboring E. bugandensis strains in particular conditions. Notably, all PG-E isolates harbor the full iro BCDEN operon ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that this region might have been horizontally transferred to the common ancestor of this group. Thus, we investigated the presence of GIs in the only complete genome available in the PG-E (II BT-08; accession GCA_000515295 [ 28 ]). GI3, encompassing 11,148 bp, harbors the entire iro BCDEN operon, confirming the horizontal transfer of this region. We also found other 31 putative GIs in this strain (Table S10).
Our results reveal an alarming antibiotic resistance profile in E. bugandensis , especially because of the presence of ESBLs. We also uncovered a sophisticated iron acquisition system and showed the presence of a salmochelin operon that is conserved in several strains, including all PG-E isolates, further supporting the monophyly of this PG. In addition, we showed that the ISS isolates belong to a separate phylogroup (PG-A) and share genes involved in capsule production. We also report, for the first time in E. bugandensis , the co-occurrence of the ESBLs bla CTX-M-55 and bla NDM-5 . Collectively, this work provides a genomic foundation for further developments towards epidemiological surveillance and biological understanding of this emerging pathogen that can colonize several niches and potentially spread AMR resistance genes.
Methods Methods vermicompost maturation Mature vermicompost was produced inside a 150 L cement ring using dry cattle manure as substrate. Humidity was kept at 60–70%, by weekly watering and mixing. After 1 month, earthworms ( Eisenia foetida ) were introduced at the rate of 5 kg∙m 3 . After 4 months, earthworms were removed and the stable vermicompost was stored in plastic bags at 25 °C. At the final maturation stage, the chemical composition of the substrate (in g∙kg − 1 ) was as follows: total nitrogen (1.9 ± 0.4); total carbon (22.99 ± 3.3); P 2 O 5 (6.97 ± 1.4); C/N ratio of 13.8 ± 0.4 and pH (H 2 O) = 6.6 ± 0.18.
Bacterial isolation and DNA purification Serial dilutions were performed on a solution prepared by the addition 10 g of vermicompost in 90 mL of saline (8.5 g∙L − 1 NaCl), followed by shaking for 60 min. Next, 1 mL of the initial dilution (10 − 1 ) was added to a new tube containing 9 mL of saline (10 − 2 ). This procedure was repeated until reaching a 10 − 7 dilution. Then, 100 μL of the final dilutions from 10 − 5 to 10 − 7 were spread on plates containing solid Nutrient Broth (NB) with 8 g∙L − 1 of NB and 15 g∙L − 1 of agar in 1 L of distilled water. After incubation at 30 °C for 7 days, individual colonies were transferred for purification to Petri plates with Dygs solid media [ 63 ] containing 2 g∙L − 1 of glucose, 2 g∙L − 1 of malic acid, 1.5 g∙L − 1 of bacteriological peptone, 2 g∙L − 1 of yeast extract, 0.5 g∙L − 1 of K 2 HPO 4 , 0.5 g∙L − 1 of MgSO 4 ∙7H2O, 1.5 g∙L − 1 of glutamic acid and 15 g∙L − 1 of agar, adjusted to pH 6.0; these supplies were acquired from Vetec (São Paulo, Brazil). From the last dilution (10 − 7 ) and after the isolation and purification on Dygs solid medium, a brown, circular, punctiform and smooth surface bacterial colony was selected. Phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of rod-shaped motile cells and Gram-negative stain under light microscopy. This distinctive isolate, named UENF-21GII, was stored in a 16 mL glass flask containing 5 mL of Nutrient Broth solid medium covered with mineral oil and, later, grown in liquid Dygs medium using a rotatory shaker at 150 rpm and 30 °C for 36 h. Total DNA of the UENF-21GII isolate was extracted using QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). DNA quantification and quality assessment were performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent, California, USA).
Genome sequencing and assembly The sequencing procedures and basic data processing were performed as previously described [ 64 ]. In summary, paired-end libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Prep (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 instrument at the Life Sciences Core Facility (LaCTAD; UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil). The quality of the sequencing reads (2 × 100 bp) was checked with FastQC 0.11.5 ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). Quality filtering was performed with Trimmomatic 0.35 [ 18 ] and reads with average quality below 30 were discarded. The E. bugandensis UENF-21GII genome was assembled with SPAdes 3.12.0 [ 19 ] and scaffolded with Gfinisher 1.4 [ 65 ], using as references the complete genome of E. bugandensis EB-247 (GCA_900324475.1) and an alternative assembly generated with Velvet 1.2.10 [ 66 ]. QUAST 5.0.1 [ 67 ] was used to assess general assembly statistics. Genome completeness was inspected with BUSCO 3.0 [ 21 ], using the Enterobacteriales dataset as reference.
Genome annotation and phylogenetic analysis The assembled genome was annotated with the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) [ 20 ]. The presence of plasmids was assessed with plasmidSPAdes 3.12 [ 68 ] and PlasmidFinder 1.3 [ 69 ]. Bacteriophage signatures were analyzed with PHASTER [ 70 ]. Genes involved in antibiotic resistance and virulence were predicted by BLAST [ 71 ] searches against the CARD database 2.03 [ 72 ] and the VFDB database [ 73 ] complemented with other reference virulence genes curated from the literature [ 74 ], respectively. For BLAST searches, we used 50% and 80% identity and coverage thresholds, respectively. The E. bugandensis UENF-21GII genome was deposited on Genbank (BioProject: PRJNA497272, accession GCF_004801095.1). Publicly available genomes were downloaded and protein sequences were predicted using PROKKA 1.13.3 [ 75 ]. Pangenome analysis was performed with BPGA 1.3.0, applying an identity cutoff of 95h [ 76 ]. Protein sequences were aligned MUSCLE 3.8.31 (default parameters) [ 77 ]. SNPs were extracted using SNP-sites 2.3.3 [ 78 ] and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions performed using RaxML 8.2.12 [ 79 ], using the ASC_GTRGAMMA, Paul Lewis standard correction and 1000 bootstrap replicates. PGAdb was used to build cg- and wgMLST by GBG, generating 3548 and 11,170 loci respectively [ 41 ]. Phylogenetic trees and gene presence/absence profiles were integrated and rendered using iTOL 3 [ 80 ]. Pyani 0.27 [ 87 ] was used to calculate ANI between all 1616 genome assemblies deposited under the Enterobacter genus (as of January of 2019). Genome-to-genome distance calculator was used to perform digital DNA-to-DNA hybridization analyses [ 23 ]. GIs were predicted using IslandViewer 4 [ 81 ], which uses: SIGI-HMM, based on codon usage bias [ 82 ]; IslandPath-DIMOB 1.0.0, based on nucleotide bias [ 83 ] and IslandPick, based on comparative genomics [ 84 ]. GIs of interest were manually inspected after computational analyses.
