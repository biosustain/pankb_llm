Ecophysiological and genomic analyses of a representative isolate of highly abundant Bacillus cereus strains in contaminated subsurface sediments
INTRODUCTION Industrial and agricultural activities have created many sites globally that are contaminated by multiple waste types including heavy metals, radionuclides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds (Abdelouas et al., 1998; Baeseman et al., 2006; Boguslavsky et al., 2020; Keskin, 2010; Riley & Zachara, 1992). Co-contaminants have the potential to influence the biogeochemical processes that are critical for transformation and removal of other components of the contamination, making the management of these sites a challenge (Arjoon et al., 2013; Duxbury, 1985; Ge et al., 2019; Gumaelius et al., 1996; Spain & Krumholz, 2011; Thorgersen et al., 2015; Thorgersen, Lancaster, Ge, et al., 2017). Frequently, heavy metals and nitrate co-exist at sites of industrial waste discharge (Baeseman et al., 2006; Moon et al., 2020; Riley & Zachara, 1992). While nitrate can be removed naturally by resident denitrifying (Foglar et al., 2005) and ammonifying (Burgin & Hamilton, 2007) microbial populations, metal co-contaminants can potentially inhibit nitrate removal either through direct inhibition of enzymes in the pathway (Sato et al., 1998; Thorgersen, Lancaster, Ge, et al., 2017) or through general inhibition of microbial growth (Bollag & Barabasz, 1979; Lu et al., 2019; Thorgersen et al., 2019). Thus, determining how heavy metals impact the physiology of field-relevant, nitrate-respiring isolates is essential to modelling the impact of co-contaminants on nitrogen cycling at field sites (Lui et al., 2021).
The US Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee contains a subsurface site contaminated by nitric acid and a mixture of heavy metals (Spain & Krumholz, 2011). This contamination is the result of discharge of liquid wastes from uranium processing operations at the on-site Y-12 National Security Complex into waste ponds (referred to as the S-3 ponds) between 1951 and 1983 (Moon et al., 2020). Waste disposal at this site ceased nearly four decades ago, and the S-3 ponds have subsequently been drained, capped, and covered by a parking lot. However, there are still five large contamination plumes of groundwater extending from the site of the former S-3 ponds (Revil et al., 2013). As a result, the near-source groundwater is highly acidic and contains high levels of uranium (U) and nitrate, as well as other metal contaminants, such as nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) (Moon et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2015). Prior studies of the ORR groundwater have found that this mixture of heavy metals and nitric acid wastes are major drivers of community assemblage and genetic potential, suggesting that these co-contaminants are significant controllers of ecological processes occurring at the site (Carlson et al., 2019; Hemme et al., 2010; Moreels et al., 2008). Metagenome sequencing of the highly contaminated ORR groundwater revealed an enrichment of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and heavy metal efflux pumps (Hemme et al., 2010). These stressors have also promoted rapid adaptive evolution of microorganisms living at the site via horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events (Casacuberta & González, 2013; Coombs & Barkay, 2004; Liang et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2006).
Here, we present the isolation and characterization of a nitrate-respiring Bacillus cereus strain that represents a dominant species within the ORR subsurface sediments as determined by 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) community analysis. This contrasts with many prior studies that have focused primarily on isolates enriched from groundwater pumped from wells at the site rather than those isolated directly from the subsurface sediments (Fields et al., 2005; Prakash et al., 2021; Thorgersen et al., 2019). The objective of this study was to examine the genomic features of this sediment-associated strain that facilitate its persistence at this mixed-waste subsurface site. We performed a pangenomic analysis to explore the genome features predicted to mediate strain resilience at the site within the broader context of the B. cereus species. To connect genome observations to relevant resistance phenotypes, we used site-informed geochemical parameters to conduct laboratory growth experiments to explore the viability of this isolate during exposure to low pH, elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides, and mixed metals. This allowed us to constrain the environmental conditions that may be permissive to its activity in the ORR subsurface.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Field sampling and geochemical measurements Sediment samples were collected from Area 3 of the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) Oak Ridge, TN which lies adjacent (southwest) to the former S-3 waste-disposal pond (Moon et al., 2020). Sediment samples were collected from the target depth using a 1.5″ diameter sediment sampler. Once at the surface, the sample casing was removed and samples were aseptically collected from the inner sections of the core using a sterile plastic scraper and stored in sterile 50 ml conical tubes at 4°C. Samples for 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing were stored at −80°C before use. Extractable pore water was separated from 10 g of sediment in an Amicon Ultra 100 K MWCO (Merck Millipore) 50 ml filtering device centrifuged at 3000 ×g at 4°C for 1 h. Pore-water nitrate was determined from a working range of 0.1–200 mg/L using an electrical conductivity detector on a Dionex™ ICS-5000+ series system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with an IonPac AS11HC analytical and AS11 guard column at 35°C with a KOH effluent gradient of 0–60 mM at 1.3 ml/min (Moon et al., 2020). Soil pH was determined using a 1:1 soil to deionized water saturation method (EPA, 2004) and measured with stirring on an Oakton® pHTestr® 50S double junction pH electrode.
16S rRNA gene (V4 region) amplicon sequencing Microbial genomic DNA was extracted by a freeze-grinding method as described previously (Zhou et al., 1996) and purified by using DNeasy PowerSoil DNA isolation Kit (QIAGEN; bead tubes were not used). DNA quality was checked by NanoDrop, and the double-stranded DNA concentration was measured by Quant-iT™ PicoGreen™ dsDNA Assay Kit. A two-step PCR was used for library preparation as described previously (Wu et al., 2015). In the first step, the standard primers were used to amplify the V4 region (253 bp in length) of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes (515F [5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′] and 806R [5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′]). In the second step, phasing primers were designed and used to increase the base diversity in sequences of sample libraries. The PCR was performed for 11 cycles in the first and 22 cycles in the second step. Sample libraries were then sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously (Caporaso et al., 2012). QIIME2 (v2021.2) (Bolyen et al., 2019) was used to process the sequencing data. After barcode and primer sequences were trimmed with zero error, exact amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were identified by DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016). The method ‘consensus’ was used to remove chimeras; samples were denoised independently; forward and reverse truncate positions were 163 and 130, respectively, after quality trim with a quality score 2; maximal expected error score was 2.0 when combining forward and reverse sequences. Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs using QIIME2 pre-fitted sklearn-based taxonomy classifier (Bokulich et al., 2018; Pedregosa et al., 2011) against the Silva 138 99% OTUs reference sequences (Quast et al., 2013), at the default confidence level (0.7). After classification, ASVs identified as Chloroplast, Mitochondria, Eukaryota, or unclassified kingdom were removed.
The full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence was retrieved from the strain CPTF genome (Goff, Lui, et al., 2022). The strain CPTF 16S rRNA gene V4 region sequence was compared to the ORR sediment 16S rRNA gene V4 region amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using a BLASTn search with default parameters. The relative abundance of the CPTF-matching ASV (ID: bdf8a26094624622d68509a87fa75ba7) across the different samples was calculated using the number of CPTF-matching ASV reads per sample divided by the total number of reads per sample. To rank the overall relative abundance of the strain CPTF-matching ASV, the total reads across all samples were determined for each ASV in the dataset. The strain CPTF-matching ASV was found to have the greatest number of total reads across the entire subsurface sediment survey. The complete ASV dataset with associated IDs is available via a published KBase narrative (Goff, Putt, et al., 2022).
Media and culture conditions Bacillus cereus str. CPT56D-587-MTF (referred to as strain CPTF) was isolated as described previously by Goff, Lui, et al. (2022). CPTF was routinely streaked out on LB plates and grown overnight at 30°C. A single isolated colony was inoculated into LB broth and grown overnight shaking at 200 rpm at 30°C. The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold into a defined medium for further experimentation. Unless otherwise specified, the growth medium contained, per litre, 2.5 g NaHCO3, 0.6 g NaH2PO4, 0.5 g casamino acids, and 40 ml of a 25× stock solution of salts composed of 5 g/L NH4Cl, 2.5 g/L KCl, 12.32 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.367 g/L CaCl2·2 H2O, and 0.25 g/L NaCl. Additionally, the medium contained, per litre, 1 ml of 1000× vitamin mix and 10 ml of a 100× DL minerals stock solution, prepared as described previously by Widdel and Bak (1992). The medium was routinely supplemented with 20 mM glucose, and 10 mM NaNO3 as a carbon source and terminal electron acceptor, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 using either HCl or NaOH. For anaerobic cultivation, the medium was purged of oxygen and a bottle headspace of 80%/20% N2/CO2 was used. The cultures were incubated at 30°C. For aerobic cultivation, cultures were shaken at 30°C at 200 rpm.
To determine the pH range permissive to strain CPTF growth, a modified medium from the one described above was used to allow for buffering from pH 3 to 8 using a 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer. This modified medium contained, per litre, 11.5 g citric acid monohydrate, 7.1 g Na2HPO4, 0.5 g casamino acids, 40 ml of the 25× stock solution described above, 1 ml of the 1000× vitamin mix described above, and 10 ml of the 100× DL minerals stock solution described above. For anaerobic cultivation, the cultures were amended with 20 mM glucose and 10 mM nitrate or 7 mM nitrite. The concentration of nitrite was selected based on the amount that typically accumulated in nitrate-respiring cultures. For aerobic cultivation, 20 mM glucose was added with additional amendments of 10 mM nitrate or 7 mM nitrite. We confirmed that this medium produced near-identical CPTF growth at pH 7.2 as the standard medium described previously. Likewise, in the absence of glucose, only minimal growth was observed. To adjust the pH of the medium, concentrated HCl and NaOH pellets were used.
To determine the growth of strain CPTF in the presence of site-relevant concentrations of metals, a contaminated ORR environmental metal mix (COMM) was used (Thorgersen et al., 2019). The 1X COMM contains 1000 μM AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 100 μM UO2(CH3COO)2, 100 μM MnCl2·4H2O, 100 μM NiSO4·6H2O, 30 μM CoCl2·6 H2O, 10 μM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O, 10 μM CuCl2·2H2O, and 5 μM Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O. The Al and U were added separately to the medium as filter-sterilized stock solutions. The remaining metals were added using a 100× filter-sterilized stock. The same metal salts at various concentrations were used for experiments with individual metals additions.
Growth curves To monitor utilization and production of nitrogen oxides, cultures were grown in Balch tubes with 10 ml of the standard medium or modified medium for pH experiments with various amendments. Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm (OD600). Samples were collected regularly for nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia determination as described below. The headspace was sampled directly for nitrous oxide measurements as detailed below.
High-throughput growth curves were conducted using a Bioscreen C automated microbiology growth curve analysis system (Growth Curves Ab Ltd., Turku, Finland) contained in a hard glove box with a 95%/5% Ar/H2 atmosphere (Plas Labs, Lansing, MI). Cultures (400 μl) were grown in 100-well honeycomb plates using the standard defined growth medium defined above with various amendments. The growth curves were conducted at 30°C with continuous agitation to avoid settling at the bottom of the plate. OD600 was measured every 30 min. Cultures growing under these standard growth conditions reached early stationary phase after approximately 10 h, the time point was selected for comparison of the extent of growth between cultures.
Nitrogen compound measurements during cell growth For the N mass balance shown in Figure 2B, nitrate and nitrite were quantified using a Dionex 5000+ (Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) equipped with a single pump, a AS11-HC column, ADRS 600 4 mm suppressor, and EGC 500 KOH cartridge as a gradient method as described previously (Moon et al., 2020). Ammonia was determined using the ammonia dichloroisocyanurate (DIC) assay in a Gallery (Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Vantaa, Finland). Nitrous oxide was quantified by direct headspace injection into a gas chromatograph (SRI, Torrance, CA) equipped with an electron capture detector and a 6 in Haysep D column with N2 as the carrier gas operating isothermally at 70°C. For all other nitrate and nitrite measurements, supernatants were collected for colorimetric analysis using the Griess assay (Miranda et al., 2001). Nitrite was measured directly at 540 nm. Nitrate was first reduced to nitrite using 8 g/L VCl3. Nitrate concentrations were calculated from the difference between [nitrate + nitrite] and [nitrite].
Genomic analyses Genome sequencing and phylogeny The strain CPTF genome was previously sequenced using a combination of long-read nanopore technology and Illumina short reads to obtain a high-quality completed genome (Goff, Lui, et al., 2022). Phylogeny was determined by average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the “Classify Microbes with GTDB-Tk”. (v1.7.0) application (Arkin et al., 2018; Chaumeil et al., 2020) implemented in the U Department of Energy (DOE) KnowledgeBase (KBase).
Pangenomic analyses To create a B. cereus pangenome, the Joint Genome Institution (JGI) Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes (IMG/M) database was searched for high-quality, finished B. cereus genomes. A total of 41 genomes were identified that met these criteria. These genomes were selected for further analyses. Plasmid counts, assembly lengths, and isolation sources were extracted from the metadata downloaded from IMG/M. Genomes were reannotated in KBase using the ‘Annotate Multiple Microbial Assemblies with RASTtk’ application (v1.073) with default parameters (Aziz et al., 2008; Brettin et al., 2015; Overbeek et al., 2014). The pangenome was computed in KBase using the ‘Compute Pangenome’ (v0.0.7) application with default parameters. Insertion sequence (IS) elements were identified in the genome set using ISSaga with default parameters (Varani et al., 2011). The annotation tables for the main chromosome for all of the genomes were used to calculate the chromosomal density of IS elements. Chromosomal density was calculated by summing the length (in bp) of all chromosomal IS elements (both partial and complete) and dividing by the total length (in bp) of the chromosome.
Phylogenetic tree construction A multi-locus species tree was constructed using the strain CPTF genome plus the 41 B. cereus genomes used for the pangenome analysis. Automated Multi-Locus Species Tree (autoMLST) was used for the concatenated alignment and tree construction (Alanjary et al., 2019). Alignment and tree construction were performed in denovo mode with default parameters except for the addition of an IQ-Tree Ultrafast Bootstap analysis (1000 replicates). The resulting concatenated alignment used 80 conserved genes given in Table S8. The final tree was visualized using Interactive Tree of Life v6 (iTOL) (Letunic & Bork, 2021).
Strain CPTF genome analysis The ACLAME database v0.4 (Leplae et al., 2010), and oriTfinder v1.1 (Li et al., 2018) in combination with manual review of annotations were used to identify plasmid features involved in mobilization and conjugal transfer in the strain CPTF genome. Plasmids were categorized as ‘conjugative’, ‘mobilizable’, and ‘non-mobilizable’ based on a classification system described by Douarre et al. (Douarre et al., 2020). The CPTF genome was analysed for heavy metal resistance genes using Geneious Prime (v2021.2.2) to perform a BLASTp search against the BacMet Antibacterial Biocide & Metal Resistance Genes Predicted Database (v2) (Pal et al., 2014). Curation of the results followed: (1) results with an e-value >1E-10 were discarded; (2) results with a query coverage <70% were discarded; (3) results with a pairwise identity <25% were discarded; and (4) results with 25% < pairwise identity <80% were manually assessed for likelihood of a positive hit based on sequence length, analysis of surrounding genomic region, and similarity of the protein annotation (Arango-Argoty et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phylogenetic and geospatial characterization of B. cereus strain CPTF Strain CPTF was isolated from a sediment sample collected from the saturated zone of the southeastern region of ORR Area 3 (long. −84.27335°, lat. 35.977268°, depth 535.94 cm) immediately adjacent to the contamination source, the former S-3 ponds. Whole-genome comparison using the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (Chaumeil et al., 2020) identified CPTF as a Bacillus cereus species with an average nucleotide identity (ANI) to the reference strain ATCC 14579 of 98.58%. Intriguingly, the strain CPTF 16S rRNA gene V4 region has 100% sequence identity to the most abundant amplicon sequence variant (ASV) observed in our 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) survey of sediment samples collected from the Area 3 subsurface (Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure 1). The relative abundance of this CPTF-matching ASV in the samples range from 0.02% to 40.52% with a median relative abundance of 3.77% (Figure 1). Importantly, the relative abundance of this ASV exceeds 5% of the total reads in 12 of the 32 samples. Thus, strain CPTF is a member of a dominant species at the site (Callahan et al., 2017). Further discussion of the distribution of strain CPTF can be found in the Supporting Information S1.
Pangenome analysis reveals significant acquisition and expansion of mobile genetic elements in strain CPTF
Pangenomic structure We used the complete genome sequence of strain CPTF (Goff, Lui, et al., 2022) to provide insight into the adaptations contributing to the resilience of this strain at the site. For comparison, we assembled a reference dataset of 41 finished B. cereus genomes in addition to the strain CPTF genome (42 genomes in total) (Figure 2A, Table S1). It is important to note that the taxonomic classification of B. cereus species and its close relatives (e.g., B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis) is controversial (Fayad et al., 2019). It is challenging to delineate these closely related species—although several recent studies have successfully done so by incorporating mobile genetic elements in their analyses (Felten et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015). For this study, we chose to analyse completed genomes annotated as ‘B. cereus’ in the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes (IMG/M) database. Our reference dataset includes strains isolated from both environmental and clinical sources. At 6.5 Mbp in length, the strain CPTF genome is substantially larger than the average B. cereus genome in our reference dataset (5.6 Mbp) (Figure 2B). The second largest genome in our dataset was 6.1 Mbp in length. Genomic analyses suggested that this size difference is largely attributable to the increased mobile genetic element (MGE) content of strain CPTF: specifically plasmids and transposable elements including insertion sequence (IS) elements and Tn3 family transposons. In our B. cereus reference dataset, the average genome contains two plasmids (range: 0–7) (Figure 2B, Table S1). By comparison, the CPTF genome contains eight plasmids (designated pCPTF 1–8) of varying size and transferability (Table S2).The plasmids themselves comprise 0.879 Mbp, or ~13% of the genome length. This increased plasmid content is notable as horizontal gene transfer can mediate the acquisition of metal resistance determinants at contaminated sites allowing for rapid adaptation to fluctuating environmental stressors (Coombs & Barkay, 2004; Hemme et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2006).
The strain CPTF genome also contains 294 complete and 180 partial IS elements, respectively (Table S3). In contrast, the average genome in the B. cereus reference dataset contains 30 (range: 10–63) and 13 (range: 1–47), respectively (Figure 2C, Table S1). The IS elements are distributed across the CPTF chromosome and six of the eight plasmids (pCPTF 1–6) (Figure S3). Approximately, 4.8% of the CPTF chromosomal genetic material consists of IS elements, both complete and partial. Typically, the density of IS elements in bacterial chromosomes is less than 3% except in extreme instances of IS expansion (Siguier et al., 2006). Indeed, the average chromosomal density of IS elements in the B. cereus reference dataset was only 0.63% (range: 0.29%–1.14%) (Figure 2C, Table S4). The high IS element content of the strain CPTF genome is suggestive of IS expansion events. IS expansion is commonly observed in bacteria that have recently adopted host-restricted lifestyles as transposition events cause gene disruptions and other genomic rearrangements, which lead to gene inactivation, gene elimination, and ultimately genomic streamlining (Siguier et al., 2014). As such, the occurrence of IS expansion within a free-living environmental isolate is puzzling. However, the hypermutability of a genome undergoing active transposition may provide a selective advantage under certain conditions. IS elements can modulate genomic content and gene expression in several ways including gene disruption, insertion of upstream promoter sequences, mobilization of neighbouring genes in the form of composite transposons, and promotion of homologous recombination (Vandecraen et al., 2017). Active transposition has been observed under various stress conditions such as oxidative stress (Drevinek et al., 2010) heavy metals (Mijnendonckx et al., 2011), and radiation (Pasternak et al., 2010).
Pangenome gene content To contextualize the gene content of strain CPTF, we computed the pangenome of the B. cereus reference dataset plus strain CPTF (42 genomes in total). The pangenome contained 16,254 unique orthologous gene clusters (Table S5). These gene clusters were further categorized as core (present in 100% of genomes), soft-core (present in 95%–99% of genomes), shell (present in 16%–94% of genomes), or cloud (present in 1%–15% of genomes). The B. cereus pangenome contains 3577 core gene clusters (22% of the pangenome), 275 soft-core gene clusters (2%), 2400 shell gene clusters (15%), and 10,003 cloud gene clusters (62%). Generally, the core genome includes all genes necessary for the basic biological functioning of a species as well as other genes that encode functions characteristic of the species. In contrast, the cloud genome includes genes typically associated with mobile genetic elements that are non-essential for growth but that confer selective advantages under different conditions, allowing for adaptation to new or fluctuating environmental niches (Medini et al., 2005). The ORR Area 3 sediments and associated pore water are unique in that multiple physiological stressors exist simultaneously: namely, high concentrations of nitrate, a mixture of heavy metals, and low pH values (Moon et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2015). We sought to connect phenotypic features of strain CPTF that are crucial for survival at this contaminated site to either the core B. cereus genome or the mobile genetic element-associated cloud genome.
Strain CPTF respires nitrate and has high nitrogen oxide resistance The sediment samples collected for the community analysis described above were also measured for pH and associated pore water nitrate concentrations. Within the pore waters of the Area 3 sediments, nitrate concentrations range from 0.007 to 609 mM with a median of 2.1 mM. Notably, the CPTF-matching ASV identified in the sediment portion of these samples is observed across the full range of associated pore-water nitrate concentrations (Figure 3A). We monitored the growth of strain CPTF with a range of nitrate concentrations under anoxic conditions to determine its level of nitrate resistance. We found that strain CPTF has a high level of nitrate resistance with an IC50 value of 579 mM (Figure 3A). Strain CPTF also has high tolerance to nitrite with an IC50 of 139 mM (Figure 3A). Generally, nitrite is highly toxic to many environmental microorganisms even at relatively low concentrations (i.e. <5 mM) (Spain & Krumholz, 2011). While high concentrations of nitrite are not routinely detected at the ORR, nitrite can transiently spike to levels >100 mM during massive microbial blooms, such as those that occurred during prior biostimulation efforts (Spain & Krumholz, 2011). Nitrite levels could also increase through a decoupling of nitrite production and reduction on a more local scale (Philips et al., 2002).
The genome of strain CPTF encodes two enzyme complexes involved in nitrogen oxide reduction, including one copy of the nar operon encoding the NarGHI nitrate reductase (Figure 3B). Across the B. cereus pangenome, narGHI were near-ubiquitous: present in 41/42, 40/42, and 40/42 analysed genomes, respectively, suggesting that nitrate respiration is a fundamental phenotypic feature of the species. Interestingly, prior metagenomic studies at the ORR Area 3 site have found that genes involved in respiring nitrogen oxides, including respiratory nitrate reductases, are enriched in the native microbial community relative to all sequenced microbial genomes (Hemme et al., 2010). This suggests that the nitrate contamination at the site has imposed a strong selective pressure on the microbial community, favouring the proliferation of nitrate-respiring organisms like strain CPTF. In line with our genomic observations, we found that strain CPTF grows by nitrate respiration at a concentration (10 mM nitrate) that is close to the median (~2 mM nitrate) at the site (Figure 3C). With glucose (20 mM) as the carbon source, nitrite and ammonia are the major products of nitrate respiration with a small fraction of nitrous oxide (0.26 ± 0.02 mM) detected at an end-point measurement, representing less than 5% of the total inorganic nitrogen. The end-point nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, and nitrous oxide can fully account for the total inorganic N added to the system (N balanced to 107.2% ± 1.5%) (Figure 3C).
Immediately adjacent to the nar operon are the genes encoding cytoplasmic NADH-dependent siroheme nitrite reductase NasDE (also known as NirBD in other organisms) (Sun et al., 2016) (Figure 3B). Similar to the nitrate reductase genes, nasDE are found in the soft core of the B. cereus pangenome with both present in 40/42 genomes. In other Bacillus species, the NasDE nitrite reductase is involved in both assimilatory and fermentative dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (Nakano et al., 1998; Sun et al., 2016). Consistent with these genomic observations, we found that CPTF consumes nitrite during anoxic fermentative growth with glucose as a carbon source (Figure S4A,B). Addition of nitrite to cultures enhanced growth on glucose compared to cultures grown with glucose alone (Figure S4B). In further agreement, CPTF was unable to grow under anoxic conditions with nitrite using non-fermentable carbon sources (Figure S4B).
Environmental factors control pH tolerance of strain CPTF The CPTF-matching ASV is observed in the contaminated ORR subsurface environment across a broad range of sediment pH values (3.1–7.1) (Figure 4A). However, when grown in batch culture with glucose (20 mM) under anoxic nitrate-respiring (10 mM nitrate) conditions, we only observed robust growth at pH values of 6.0 and 7.0 with slightly higher growth observed at pH 7.0 (Figure 4B). Substantially lower growth was observed at pH 5.0. We predicted that the accumulation of nitrite during nitrate respiration in our batch cultures increased the sensitivity of the strain to lower pH due to the increased proportion of the protonophore nitrous acid (Vadivelu et al., 2006). When CPTF was grown under oxygenated conditions without added nitrate, robust growth was observed down to pH 5.0 and the pH optimum shifted to 6.0 (Figure 4B). The addition of nitrate or nitrite (7 mM, the typical amount accumulated during nitrate respiration) to the cultures under these same oxygenated conditions increased the sensitivity of the cells to the lower pH and growth was significantly diminished at pH 5.0. Thus, local accumulation of nitrite in the environment may increase the sensitivity of the strain to more acidic growth conditions. This could occur, for example, during massive blooms of nitrate-respiring organisms at the site (Spain & Krumholz, 2011).
Even under conditions where nitrate/nitrite were not added (i.e. under aerobic growth conditions) no growth was observed by 36 h at either pH 3.0 or 4.0. However, we were able to recover viable cells up to 120 h by transferring from these low pH cultures to LB broth at various time points post-inoculation. Further recovery was not monitored post-120 h. These results suggest that, in the field, the cells may persist in a slow-growing state at these lower recorded pH values. Alternatively, microheterogeneity of the subsurface sediment may result in pockets of higher pHs values that are not reflected by bulk pH measurements (Sumner, 1994). The strain CPTF genome encodes several proteins that may facilitate surface attachment and stasis within a sediment microniche conducive towards its growth including flagellar proteins and surface adhesins. Nonetheless, there is also suggestion of genetically encoded mechanisms of acid tolerance in the CPTF genome. For example, the pCPTF1 megaplasmid carries a copy of the ureDABCEFG urease operon, which may play a role in pH tolerance. Interestingly, the complete ureDABCEFG operon was only observed in 2 out of the 42 analysed B. cereus genomes including strain CPTF. Both gram-negative and gram-positive human GI tract commensal microorganisms rely on urease activity to buffer against acidity in their local environments (Huang et al., 2014; Merrell & Camilli, 2002). As urea is ubiquitous in natural environments, urease may be an adaptive feature for pH tolerance in subsurface sediment environments (Wang et al., 2008). Other possible features of the acid-tolerance response observed in the strain CPTF genome include an arginine decarboxylase (a core genome feature) and an arginine deiminase (observed in 29/42 genomes) (Carlin et al., 2010).
Strain CPTF is adapted to growth with mixed-metals contaminants We hypothesized that strain CPTF would have extensive metal homeostasis systems to protect against the multiple metals stress of its native environment (Hemme et al., 2010). Comparison of the CPTF genome against the BacMet antibacterial, biocide, and metal resistance genes database (Pal et al., 2014) revealed 138 putative metal homeostasis determinants, including those annotated for Al (1 genetic determinant), Mn (8), Fe (40), Cd (8), Cu (18), Co (14), and Ni (2) homeostasis (Table S6). These seven metals are all major components of the ORR contaminant plume (Smith et al., 2015; Thorgersen et al., 2015) (Table S7). The remaining determinants are annotated as being involved in homeostasis of other metals/metalloids that are not significant components of the ORR contamination plume such as As, Sb, Se, Te, and Hg.
Several of these genetic determinants were ubiquitous among B. cereus species and clustered into three regions of the CPTF chromosome. The first region contained three copies of the gene encoding the tellurite resistance determinant TerD (all three copies are present in 42/42 B. cereus genomes). TerD has been suggested to have functions relating to general stress responses and tellurite resistance is unlikely to be the main function of these proteins (Daigle et al., 2015). The terD genes clustered with a cation-transporting ATPase (42/42 genomes) and a general stress response protein (42/42 genomes). The second region included the feuABC genes which are involved in the uptake of the siderophore bacillibactin (42/42 genomes).These genes were found immediately downstream from a gene encoding a ferrichrome transport protein (42/42 genomes) and a trilactone hydrolase (42/42 genomes) which releases iron from bacillibactin in the cytosol. Maintenance of iron homeostasis appears to be important in the cellular response to divalent heavy metal cation stress, for example, Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ (Chandrangsu et al., 2017). Included in this region was a gene encoding a metal efflux P-type ATPase (42/42 genomes). P-type ATPases are involved in the membrane transport of metal cations commonly found in the ORR subsurface (e.g. Cd2+, Cu+) (Nies, 2003). Also present was a CsoR repressor (42/42 genomes) which regulates activity of CopZA, a Cu2+-transport system. The third region includes a gene encoding a second metal efflux P-type ATPase (42/42 genomes) and a gene encoding a Cd2+ efflux accessory protein (42/42 genomes). Thus, B. cereus species appear to contain a core set of heavy metal resistance genes that may allow for adaptation to fluctuating soil environments.
In contrast, the eight plasmids of strain CPTF contained a number of metal resistance determinants that are largely unique to strain CPTF. The pCPTF1 megaplasmid (4.5 Mbp) contains two metal-responsive ArsR family transcriptional regulators (both present in 1/42 genomes; unique to strain CPTF) and one metal-responsive MerR family transcriptional regulator (4/42 genomes). Characterized members of the ArsR and MerR families regulate cellular responses to various metal cations including those found in the ORR subsurface such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ (Brown et al., 2003; Busenlehner et al., 2003). Also present on pCPTF1 is an RND family cation/drug efflux pump (1/42 genomes; unique to strain CPTF) (Du et al., 2018); a TerC-like integral membrane protein that has been shown to mediate Mn resistance in B. subtilis (Paruthiyil et al., 2020) (unique to strain CPTF genome); and a NixA Ni/Co transporter (3/42 genomes) (Dosanjh & Michel, 2006). Among the remaining seven smaller plasmids, heavy metal resistance-related genes included ArsR family transcriptional regulators (3/7 plasmids) and MerR family transcriptional regulators (2/7 plasmids), all unique to the strain CPTF genome. Gene regulation evolves rapidly and new transcription factors will often arise via gene duplication events that can result in novel regulatory interactions (Price et al., 2007; Teichmann & Babu, 2004). A larger repertoire of transcription factors may be an adaptive feature that allows microorganisms living in high-stress and fluctuating environments to integrate a larger number of environmental signals (Cases et al., 2003). An interesting example of a suspected gene duplication event in the strain CPTF genome is the five plasmid-borne ArsR homologues. These plasmid-loc ArsR regulators form a phylogenetically distinct cluster from their 11 chromosomal ArsR homologues (Figure S5A). We observed cryptic IS element scars on one or both flanking regions of these plasmid-localized sequences in addition to preserved neighbouring gene synteny (Figure S5B). We propose that this metal-responsive regulatory element has undergone multiple IS element-mediated duplication events across the plasmids.
We next examined whether this heavy metal resistance gene content was reflected in a broad heavy metal resistance phenotype for strain CPTF. We used previously published measurements of metal concentrations in the nearby groundwater from Area 3 wells for determination of the metal resistance of strain CPTF (Smith et al., 2015; Thorgersen et al., 2015; Thorgersen et al., 2019) as the sediments of the Area 3 subsurface are frequently saturated by this groundwater (Moon et al., 2020). Consistent with our genomic observations, strain CPTF was resistant to site-relevant concentrations of Cd (up to 10 μM), Cu (up to 20 μM), Al (up to 2000 μM), Mn (up to 200 μM), and Fe (up to 20 μM) (Table S7, Figure S6). While Ni and Co inhibited the growth of strain CPTF at higher site-relevant concentrations of 200 and 60 μM, respectively, these cultures still produced measurable growth. Additionally, while no U resistance determinants were identified in the strain CPTF genome due to their absence in the BacMet database, we observed resistance to site relevant concentrations of U (up to 200 μM). This is likely because a major mechanism of U resistance in bacteria is adsorption to the cell surface (Fowle et al., 2000; Pinel-Cabello et al., 2021; Thorgersen, Lancaster, Rajeev, et al., 2017). Finally, we quantified strain CPTF resistance to a site-relevant mixture of metals. Previously, we developed a contaminated ORR environmental metal mixture (COMM) designed to reflect the average concentrations of the major metal contaminants of the Area 3 groundwater (Table S7) (Thorgersen et al., 2019). We monitored the growth of strain CPTF with glucose (20 mM) as a carbon source under nitrate-respiring conditions with dilutions of the COMM (Figure 5A,B). We calculated an IC50 for the mixture of 0.84× (see Figure 5B for individual metal concentrations). Notably, growth was still observed even at the 1X concentration. Interestingly, we also observed that the COMM inhibited nitrite reduction in the cultures (Figure S7).This is in line with prior studies that show the divalent metal cations Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ cause an accumulation of nitrite in cultures of denitrifying microorganisms (Gui et al., 2017; Ramírez et al., 2018).
CONCLUDING REMARKS Our results suggest that core B. cereus genes and mobilomic flexibility have allowed for strain CPTF to successfully occupy the heterogenous, contaminated microniches of the ORR Area 3 subsurface sediments. There are two major caveats to the conclusions presented here. First, it will always be challenging to extrapolate laboratory observations of metal toxicity to the field (Duxbury, 1985). Numerous factors that control metal speciation and solubility—including pH, inorganic ions, and carbon compounds—are difficult to match between field and laboratory conditions (Duxbury, 1985; Gadd, 2010). This challenge is further amplified within a solid matrix, as particle surface sites will adsorb metals (Bradl, 2004). However, we partially remedy this issue here by assessing metal toxicity in the presence of two of the major categories of co-contaminants: (1) nitrate and (2) other metals. Second, the 16S rRNA gene V4 region does not allow for strain-level resolution (Edgar, 2018). Thus, the CPTF-matching ASV may represent a collection of closely related B. cereus strains. We suggest, though, that these strains will share the same core set genes identified in this study as well as many of the same cloud genes due to their close physical proximity.
While it is apparent that mobile genetic elements have contributed to the resilience of strain CPTF at this site, an intriguing question that lingers is whether the environmental stressors promoted horizontal gene transfer and IS expansion in the strain CPTF genome? Or, did the waste contaminants at ORR select for a native organism whose mobilome had already undergone extensive expansion prompted by an unrelated cause? How genome evolution, particularly the mobility of certain genetic elements within microbial populations, facilitates resilience in the face of environmental stressors is a critical topic of research when studying microbial processes at contaminated sites.
