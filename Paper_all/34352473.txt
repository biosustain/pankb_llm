Title: In silico comparative genomics analysis of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DW12, a potential gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing strain
Abstract: Graphical abstract Introduction Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a natural amino acid synthesized by the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) operon ( Wu et al., 2017 ). GABA is one of the key inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of mammals. It can reduce neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system ( Boonstra et al., 2015 ). It has been widely used as a dietary supplement to help improve sleeplessness, relieve anxiety, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), promote the growth of muscle, and adjust blood pressure ( Ngo and Vo, 2019 ). Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are key producers of GABA found in several habitats in the environment and foods. Therefore, many food industries widely used LAB to produce GABA as LAB are “generally recognized as safe (GRAS)” ( Adams, 1999 ). Nowadays, many LAB species have been proposed to be used as a probiotic starter cultures to produce GABA in fermented food and beverage industries, including Lactobacillus brevis ( Gao et al., 2019 ; Santos-Espinosa et al., 2020 ), Lactobacillus pentosus ( Zhong et al., 2019 ), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei ( Komatsuzaki et al., 2005 , 2008 ), Lactobacillus buchneri ( Barla et al., 2016 ; Cho et al., 2007 ), and Lactobacillus plantarum ( Di Cagno et al., 2010 ) (recently referred to as Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus pentosus , Lentilactobacillus buchneri , and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, respectively ( Zheng et al., 2020 )).
In recent years, many researchers have been explored and studied L. plantarum in particular for its ability to synthesize GABA using the GAD system. For example, L. plantarum KB1253 ( Nakatani et al., 2019 ) has been investigated using next-generation sequencing technology. This strain is used in GABA-enriched tomato juice production. Furthermore, L. plantarum L10-11 produced a maximum amount of GABA of 15.74 g/L after 48 h in MRS supplemented with 4% monosodium glutamate (MSG); it has been proposed to be used as a starter culture for enhancing the GABA content in fermented vegetables. Also, L. plantarum DW12 ( Ratanaburee et al., 2011 ) isolated from a fermented red seaweed has been shown to be able to effectively synthesize GABA compared with other LAB species. L. plantarum DW12 produced over 4 g/L GABA after 24 h in MRS supplemented with 0.5 % MSG. Additionally, L. plantarum DW12 was used as a probiotic starter in mature coconut water for producing a functional beverage enriched with GABA, vitamin B12, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens ( Kantachote et al., 2017 ). However, genomic insight into L. plantarum DW12 and related information about food safety still need to be studied and obtained.
In this paper, we, therefore, present an in-silico genomics analysis of L. plantarum DW12, a potential GABA-producing strain. The complete genome was proposed using hybrid sequencing technology. Comparative and pan-genome analyses of all the 576 genomes of L. plantarum in the public database were performed. This is the first study that used all the genome sequences to compare and underline the diversity among the L. plantarum strains. The GAD system and bacteriocin locus of L. plantarum DW12 and all strains were identified and discussed. Phylogenetic analysis is also presented to compare the DW12 with other GABA-producing strains. Finally, a safety assessment was evaluated using several bioinformatics tools and databases.
Materials and methods Bacterial strains, media, and culture conditions L. plantarum DW12 was previously isolated from a fermented red seaweed by Ratanaburee et al. ( Ratanaburee et al., 2011 ). L. plantarum DW12 was cultured in MRS broth at 37 °C for 24 h under microaerophilic conditions. For the stock culture, the MRS culture broth was mixed with 20 % glycerol and kept at −80 °C.
Genomic DNA extraction and sequencing We extracted and purified the genomic DNA of L. plantarum DW12 using the Presto™ Mini gDNA Bacteria kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taiwan) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. A NanoDrop™2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) was then used to evaluate the concentration and the DNA quality. Purified genomic DNA was sent to sequence with a PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States), and a NextSeq™ 550 System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States). The RSII library for long-read sequencing was prepared using the 10 kb protocol and sequenced in SMRT cell with P4-C2 chemistry. For the short-read sequencing, we did in-house inside in the Prince of Songkla University. The Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit was used to constructed the sequencing library and then processed in the sequencer with High-output mode to generate 150-bp paired-end reads using the NextSeq 550 system.
Genome assembly and annotation The long reads from PacBio sequencing were first cleaned to improve the overall quality by trimming uncorrected bases to minimize the errors from the sequencer. We used Canu ( Koren et al., 2017 ) to trim and assemble reads by removing reads shorter than 1,000 bp and quality scores lower than 85 %. Only 93,971 subreads with an average length of 5,471 bp remained for the assembling process. Various sizes of k-mers were applied to identify the best assembly. Each assembly result was evaluated and compared based on various assembly matrices using Quast ( Gurevich et al., 2013 ). The completeness of genome assembly was calculated by Busco ( Simao et al., 2015 ; Waterhouse et al., 2018 ). The assembly graphs were visualized to view the contiguity of results using Bandage ( Wick et al., 2015 ). The best assembly was then selected using as a reference the alignment of the paired-end reads back to the contigs using BWA-mem ( Houtgast et al., 2018 ). The unmapped reads were then extracted from the alignment using SAMTOOLS ( Li et al., 2009 ) to identify small plasmids using SPADES ( Bankevich et al., 2012 ).
The plasmid was scanned using several bioinformatics tools including PlasmidFinder ( Carattoli and Hasman, 2020 ), BLASTx, and BLASTp as described previously ( Surachat et al., 2020 ). The contigs were then circularized and polished using Circlator ( Hunt et al., 2015 ) and Pilon ( Walker et al., 2014 ), respectively. The annotation to identify the coding sequencing was performed using Rapid Annotations using the Subsystems Technology (RAST) server ( Aziz et al., 2008 ) rRNAs and tRNAs were identified by RNAmmer ( Lagesen et al., 2007 ) and tRNAscan-SE ( Schattner et al., 2005 ), respectively.
The tandem repeats and the prophage regions were predicted using Tandem Repeat Finder ( Benson, 1999 ), PHASTER ( Arndt et al., 2016 ), respectively. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were scanned by CRISPRFinder ( Grissa et al., 2007 ). Transmembrane helices were demonstrated using TMHMM Server 2.0 ( Krogh et al., 2001 ). The genomic islands were searched against several databases using IslandViewer 4 ( Bertelli et al., 2017 ). For integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), we used ICEberg 2.0 server ( Liu et al., 2019 ) to predict and identify the mobile genetic elements. Finally, the visualization of the genomic data was performed by Circos 0.69–9 ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ) and CGView Server 1.0 ( Grant and Stothard, 2008 ). The bioinformatics workflow of genome assembly is illustrated in Fig. S1.
Comparative genomic and bioinformatics analysis In total, 584 genomes (155 complete genomes, 186 scaffolds, and 243 contig levels) of L. plantarum used in this investigation were retrieved from the GenBank database. We then removed eight bacterial strains from further analysis since they were re-assembled in the different submission names. All 576 genomes were re-annotated with the same method to avoid biases of the gene-calling process in the comparisons due to different annotation protocols by Prokka 1.14.6 ( Seemann, 2014 ). The obtained general feature format (GFF) files were then used to perform a pan-genome analysis to identify core, accessory, and unique protein families using Roary ( Page et al., 2015 ) by setting a threshold of 95 % BLASTp and standard parameters. In addition, we also performed a pan-genome analysis on 31 GABA-producing strains. We selected the strains based on the literature reviews and availability of the genomic sequences in the public database. The list of bacterial strains used in the pan-genome analysis is given in Table S1. Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and bacteriocin-encoding genes were identiﬁed by a sequence similarity search using BLASTp against the Bagel database ( de Jong et al., 2010 ). Gene clusters of interest were then analyzed and visualized by the Bagel4 webserver ( van Heel et al., 2018 ). Also, all restriction-modification (R-M) systems were searched in all genomes by BLASTn against the R-M genes retrieved from the NCBI database using an E-value of 1e-10 and blast coverage of 0.35 as the cutoff threshold.
Furthermore, we used 640 core genes from 577 bacterial strains (including DW12) to perform multiple alignments using MUSCLE ( Edgar, 2004 ). We then constructed the phylogenetic trees by MEGAX software ( Kumar et al., 2018 ). The neighbor-joining method was used and tree reliability was tested using the bootstrap method by setting the number of bootstrap repetitions at 1,000.
The entire genome of L. plantarum DW12 was screened by following the recommendations of the EFSA Guidance ( Rychen et al., 2018 ) to search for pathogenic, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and other related genes in food safety. The antibiotic-resistance genes were searched using the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) server ( Alcock et al., 2020 ). The stability of the genome was evaluated by using several tools including PHASTER ( Arndt et al., 2016 ), PathogenFinder ( Cosentino et al., 2013 ), ISfinder ( Siguier et al., 2006 ), and PlasmidFinder ( Carattoli and Hasman, 2020 ) to identify prophage, pathogenic genes, insert sequences, and plasmid sequences, respectively.
Results and discussion Genomic features and functional annotation of L. plantarum DW12 The genome comprises one 3,217,574-bp circular chromosome. The genomic features of the DW12 genome are illustrated in Fig. 1 . No plasmid was present in the identification. We identified 3,188 protein-coding genes, 85 rRNA genes, and 234 subsystems in the chromosome, as shown in Table 1 .
Among the identified ORFs, 1,040 genes (33.88 %) were unknown or hypothetical. The remaining 2,108 genes (66.12 %) were predicted to be functional genes. Classification of ORFs based on the SEED subsystem categorization from the RAST server is shown in Fig. S2. The SEED subsystem categorization of the DW12 strain was classified into 25 subsystems. Only 2 subsystems were missing: “Motility and Chemotaxis” and “Photosynthesis.” There were 168 ORFs assigned in the subsystem "Amino Acids and Derivatives,” seven of them involving the production of GABA in this strain. Besides, “Carbohydrates” was the most classified subsystem with 234 ORFs, while the other ORFs were assigned in “Central Carbohydrate Metabolism” (64 ORFs), “Fermentation” (43 ORFs), and “Di- and oligosaccharides” (36 ORFs).
Comparative genomic analysis The whole genome sequence of L. plantarum DW12 was first searched in the NCBI database using Microbial Nucleotide BLAST by setting the database to “All genomes.” The top three closest organisms were L. plantarum CACC 558, L. plantarum RI-113, and L. plantarum NCU116, with the following identity and query coverage percentages: (99.96, 95), (99.74, 92), and (99.69, 91), respectively. We then selected CACC 558, RI-113, and WCFS1 (representative genome) for comparison. Compared with the other strains, the DW12 strain was found to have several unique regions, including csn1 , cas1 , cas2 , and cas9 . These regions might improve the stability of DW12 to survive in the environment.
Pan-genome analysis was also performed to evaluate the diversity among the L. plantarum strains by comparing the DW12 with all genomes of L. plantarum from the GenBank database. 577 genomes including DW12 were used in this analysis. As a result, we identified a pan-genome of 34,550 gene clusters, including a core gene set (1.85 %, 640 genes), an accessory gene set (61.15 %, 21,127 genes), and a strain-specific gene set 38.40 %, 13,266 genes). The group of genes shared by all strains with a gene sequence similarity higher than 95 % was defined as the core gene set.
For the group of genes that is not present in every strain, and the group of genes that is present in only one specific strain were clarified as the accessory gene and the strain-specific gene set, respectively. Interestingly, the DW12 strain was found to contain 36 strain-specific genes that were not present in any of the strain compared. From those genes, 30 of them were identified as hypothetical proteins. The visualization of the pan-genome analysis is shown in Fig. 2 A. The large gene set of accessory genes indicates a high level of genetic diversity in this species.
Furthermore, we also investigated the openness of L. plantarum using pan-genome analysis data. The trend of pan genes of L. plantarum is still significantly growing and tends to be open genome even the genomes were sequenced over 500 times as shown in Fig. 2 B. L. plantarum can be naturally found in different sources. The horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genetic mutation could be the important mechanisms of bacterial strains to adapt themselves into living environments which directly influences genomic plasticity within this species ( van Reenen and Dicks, 2011 ; Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011 ). This information indicates that it is still necessary to sequence more L. plantarum genomes to study the genomic diversity and discover new genes until this species reaches a closed pan-genome characteristic.
Phylogenetic analysis Due to the high sequence similarities between the 16S rRNA genes, the evolutionary history of L. plantarum is very difficult to determine. Therefore, we built a phylogenetic tree based on the core genes (640 genes) from all the genomes. These genes were then extracted, and the phylogenetical relationships were analyzed to construct the evolutionary tree shown in Fig. S3. L. plantarum DW12 is located in the same clade with AJ11 and CAC_558 which were previously isolated from canine feces and fermented olive, respectively. Also, the DW12 is close to WCFS1, a representative sequence of L. plantarum . The genomic diversity among L. plantarum strains is likely complex and the phylogenetic distances are quite different. L. plantarum can be found in various hosts and environments including humans, animals, food, etc. The habitats of bacterial strains could affect strongly genomic diversity since mobile genetic elements including plasmids and transposons from other organisms can be possibly transferred during evolution times. In addition, spontaneous mutations are one of the important factors increasing genetic diversity and rapid evolution among this species.
Prophage and mobile genetic element analysis Generally, prophages are common genetic components that are widely found in many lactobacilli ( Ramisetty and Sudhakari, 2019 ; Ventura et al., 2003 ), including Lacticaseibacillus casei , Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus johnsonii , and L. plantarum . In the DW12 strain, three prophage regions were detected, including one incomplete, one questionable, and one intact prophage, as shown in Fig. 3 . The sizes of the regions were 25.8 kb, 27 kb, and 41.8 kb, respectively. The Prophage 1 (incomplete) region was located from 1,165,919 to 1,191,802 bp, with 21 CDSs. Most of the components are hypothetical proteins that are similar to proteins of several LAB species. Also, one phage integrase was predicted to be Lactob_Sha1. Lactob_Sha1 ( Lactobacillus phage Sha1) is a common phage found in various organisms ( Evanovich et al., 2019 ). This mobile genetic element could transfer among the lactobacilli during their evolution. The Prophage 2 (questionable) region was found at 1,178,481 to 1,205,494 bp, with 29 CDSs. The predicted phage proteins found in this region were terminase, portal, and lysin. The Prophage 3 region (intact) was located from 1,499,986 to 1,541,862 bp, with 51 CDSs. The attL and attR sites were found in this region, so its extent was easily identified. Moreover, various components were predicted, including integrase, terminase, portal, coat, tail, lysin, virion, and capsid. We found Lactob_Sha1, Lactob_phig1e, Lactob_iLp84, Lactob_LP65, Geobac_TP_84, and Entero_phiFL2A, which could be important information for reconstructing the evolution of L. plantarum DW12.
CRISPRs are genetic elements that form by the repetition of DNA sequences within a specific area. CRISPRs play an important role in defending the organism against foreign genetic elements ( Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008 ). In the L. plantarum DW12 genome, a CRISPR locus was identified with a length of 761 bp, extending from 114,962 to 115,723 bp. The identified CRISPR-associated genes were csn1 , cas1 , cas2 , and cas9 . These genes might reveal how DW12 has adapted itself to different conditions and environments over time.
Identification of bacteriocin loci Bacteriocins were mostly produced by bacteria. It provides a special ability to bacteria in inhibiting the growth of similar or closely related bacteria ( Shrode, 2014 ). Most of the strains in the L. plantarum have various antimicrobial activities against foodborne pathogens ( Yepez et al., 2017 ). In the DW12 genome, too, a bacteriocin-encoding locus was found with a size of 29 kbp at a location from 374,965 to 404,460 bp consisting of 61 genes (Table S2). Several important context genes were identified in this region, including glyS , lanT , and hlyD . Also, they are accessory factors for an ABC transporter that may be involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins in this genome. Furthermore, plantaricin A, E, F, J, K, and N were identified as core proteins in this region. The bacteriocin locus is shown in Fig. 4 A.
In addition, we performed BLASTx analysis using 577 genomes of L. plantarum strains against the bacteriocin database to investigate the presence/absence of the bacteriocin-encoding gene. As a result, only 5 strains (0.87 %) were found genes identified in the class I bacteriocins including enterocin W alpha, plantaricin W (alpha and beta), mutacin III, and gassericin A. Interestingly, 532 (92.20 %) of L. plantarum strains encodes class II bacteriocin genes in their genome. 33 different antimicrobial peptides in this species were identified in all genomes. Not surprisingly, the most common bacteriocins found in L. plantarum are plantaricins including F (86.82 %), E (86.13 %), J (51.12 %), K (46.10 %), A (45.58 %), and N (41.07 %) as shown in Fig. 4 B and Table S3. Furthermore, only 62 (10.91 %) strains were found bacteriocin-encoding genes in class III bacteriocin which were zoocin A and enterolysin A. This meta-analysis reveals that L. plantarum is one of the important bacteriocin-producing strains. They also have probiotic properties which could be useful in different applications including functional food industries, health, and medical care ( Olasupo, 1996 ; Todorov, 2009 ). Especially in fermented food and dairy product, bacteriocins’ activities are very important. They could help bacteria to inhibit and kill spoilage bacteria and foodborne pathogens. Also, in the DW12, we identified several plantaricin-encoding genes which are very important properties of a starter culture since these bacteriocins provide abilities to prevent outgrowth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms including Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus spp. ( Kareem and Razavi, 2020 ; Olasupo, 1996 ; Todorov, 2009 ; van Reenen et al., 1998 ). The R-M systems was also identified using BLASTn against R-M genes downloaded from the NCBI. Interestingly, we found only hsd genes in L. plantarum strains as shown in Table S3.
Identification of GAD operon in L. plantarum strains We also investigated the presence of GAD operon of all available L. plantarum strains (n = 577). Interestingly, we found gadB in 573 strains (99.31 %). The similarities of the sequences ranged from 94.24 %–100 % with mismatches between 0–22 bases. Only four strains were not found gadB in their genomes which were EGD-AQ4 (GCA_000463075.2), ERR1430514-bin.5 (GCA_905192725.1), SRCM101258 (GCA_002906095.1), and SN13 T (GCA_013394345.1) sizing from 2.98 to 3.69 Mbp. The genome coverages of these genomes were 66, 10, 8, and 123x, respectively. For genome with low coverage data (ERR1430514-bin.5 and SRCM101258), this may directly influence the length and number of contigs and scaffolds in the assembly outputs causing the absence of gadB in these genomes. On the other hand, the missing of this gene may cause by gene deletion which is a regular process of evolution in bacteria ( Bolotin and Hershberg, 2016 ; Koskiniemi et al., 2012 ). In addition, we found some conserved sequences of gadC in several regions of all strains, while gadR was carried in only 52 strains (9.12 %). This investigation indicates that L. plantarum is a key GABA-producing species in nature since almost all strains were encoded GAD operon in their genome. However, this finding could not suggest that all L. plantarum can potentially produce GABA. Several factors affect this trait and ability including environmental and growing conditions ( Dhakal et al., 2012 ; Zhong et al., 2019 ), cell physiology ( Lyu et al., 2017 ), and related genetic elements ( Hoftman et al., 2015 ).
Comparison of GABA-producing strains GABA is a potent bioactive compound that could have crucial physiological functions, such as antihypertensive and antidepressant activities ( Cui et al., 2020 ). GABA is widely produced by LAB using the biosynthesis pathway ( Shin et al., 2014 ). GAD is the essential enzyme in GABA biosynthesis ( Lyu et al., 2018 ). To synthesize GABA, bacteria use the GadB enzyme for catalyzing glutamate decarboxylation with cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP), resulting in GABA formation and CO 2 secretion as a byproduct. GABA product is then transported to the extracellular matrix by Glu/GABA antiporter GadC ( Barla et al., 2016 ; Cho et al., 2007 ; Di Cagno et al., 2010 ).
The genome of the DW12 contains one gadB gene that encodes for GAD. This gene is located near the LysM peptidoglycan-binding domain-containing protein and pck gene. The arrangement of genes in the GAD operon in closely related strains is quite similar to the DW12, as shown in Fig. 5 A. The DW12, CACC 558, LQ80, WCFS1, and ZS2058 strains shared the same strand of genes, while the NCU116, Heal19, and FBL-3a strains had the opposite strand of genes in the region. We also performed phylogenetic analysis to investigate the GAD genes in the L. plantarum ( Fig. 5 B) using the gadB gene (∼ 468 aa). Two additional GABA-producing strains were included in this analysis, namely Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum L-ZS9 and L. brevis CD0817 ( Gao et al., 2019 ). The sequences in the L. plantarum strains had a similarity of over 99.7 %, as there were only 2-4 substitutions. The differences between the L. plantarum strains with the other species were obvious, as the similarities of the sequences ranged between 56.0 % and 82.0 %. Interestingly, we also found some sequences that conserved gadC , gadC_2 , and gadC _3 in different locations outside the GAD operon. Commonly, gadB and gadC are both found in several genera including Lactobacillus (before reclassification), Enterococcus , and Streptococcus . Some species of Limosilactobacillus and Lactiplantibacillus e.g. fermentum and paraplantarum encode only gadB . Only L. brevis strains were identified all GAD genes including gadA , gadB , gadC , and gadR as shown in Fig. 6 .
Furthermore, we selected 31 GABA-producing strains to perform pan-genome analysis. The list of selected strains and related information including isolation sources, geographic location, and pathogen risk assessment is given in Table 2 . The pan-genome was identified by setting a threshold of 60.0 % BLASTp. We identified 35,482 pan genes among selected strains. Only 19 core genes were found indicating high genomic diversity of GABA-producing strains used in this study as shown in Fig. S4. While the strain-specific genes were found approximately 22,000 genes (62.0 %). The bacterial strains selected in this comparative study were obtained from different isolation sources including human-associated habitat, animal-associated habitat, food, and beverage. This could explain why a huge amount of the strain-specific genetic elements were identified in this analysis. Also, the diversity of the genus of the selected strains directly affects a low number of core genes found in the pan-genome.
Unfortunately, the pathogen risk assessment scores of some strains including Enterococcus faecium DO, Enterococcus faecalis R5E, and Enterococcus avium 352 are extremely high (over 0.8). Moreover, we also found genes conferring resistance to available antibiotics, such as gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, and erythromycin. These finding could indicate that these strains might be a potentially pathogenic bacteria causing severe infection in the human and animals.
Importantly, we investigated the genes encoding for bacteriocin and prokaryotic R-M systems to confirm the probiotic properties among 32 bacterial strains. The finding exhibited that 19 (59.4 %) and 21 (65.6 %) strains harbored bacteriocin and R-M genes, respectively. Notably, these genes were detected in the DW12 strain. Since bacteriocin provides antimicrobial activity and the R-M system is a defense mechanism against invading genomes ( Vasu and Nagaraja, 2013 ), L. plantarum DW12 could be a good candidate as a starter culture with strong probiotic activities for many applications.
Safety assessment We did not find transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in the identification using Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) in the CARD database. Also, pathogenicity factors were not detected in this genome. The DW12 strain was considered to be a nonhuman pathogen, with a probability of only 0.248 of being a human pathogen according to the PathogenFinder web server. A CRISPR region was identified in the DW12 genome which could help this bacterium to provide immunity against the mobile genetic DNA of other organisms. This could be an important mechanism by which DW12 prevents itself from antibiotic resistance and pathogenic genes during evolution and horizontal gene transfer ( Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008 ). Therefore, these in silico analyses could provide the safety information of using L. plantarum DW12 in applications. However, in vivo safety assessment is still required to guarantee safety before using this strain with related human- and animal-related products.
Conclusions L. plantarum DW12 is a high GABA-producing strain. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive genome analysis to obtain molecular basis insight into the L. plantarum DW12 genome. The complete genome sequence was compared with 577 genomes of L. plantarum to display the genetic diversity among this species. In addition, in silico identification of the bacteriocin loci reveal that L. plantarum strains contain various class II bacteriocin-encoding genes, particularly plantaricin genes. These bacteriocins provide interesting mechanisms to inhibit the growth of pathogens and do not affect eukaryotic cells. Results from this study also showed that L. plantarum DW12 encoded significant pathways of GAD biosynthesis, supporting its ability to potentially synthesize GABA. Furthermore, safety assessment analysis demonstrated that there was no evidence for virulence factors or AMR genes in the DW12 genome. Thus, the DW12 could be a good candidate for use as a starter culture in the food and beverage industries.
