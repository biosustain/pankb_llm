Characterization of Martelella soudanensis sp. nov., Isolated from a Mine Sediment
Abstract Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and rod-shaped bacterial strains, designated NC18T and NC20, were isolated from the sediment near-vertical borehole effluent originating 714 m below the subsurface located in the Soudan Iron Mine in Minnesota, USA. The 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strains NC18T and NC20 grouped with members of the genus Martelella, including M. mediterranea DSM 17316T and M. limonii YC7034T. The genome sizes and G + C content of both NC18T and NC20 were 6.1 Mb and 61.8 mol%, respectively. Average nucleotide identity (ANI), the average amino acid identity (AAI), and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were below the species delineation threshold. Pan-genomic analysis showed that NC18T, NC20, M. mediterranea DSM 17316T, M. endophytica YC6887T, and M. lutilitoris GH2-6T had 8470 pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs) in total. Five Martelella strains shared 2258 POG core, which were mainly associated with amino acid transport and metabolism, general function prediction only, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, and transcription. The two novel strains had major fatty acids (>5%) including summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c), C19:0 cyclo ω8c, C16:0, C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl, C18:0, and summed feature 2 (C12:0 aldehyde and/or iso-C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3-OH). The sole respiratory quinone was uniquinone-10 (Q-10). On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic analyses, strains NC18T and NC20 represent novel species of the genus Martelella, for which the name Martelella soudanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NC18T (=KTCT 82174T = NBRC 114661T).
Keywords: Martelella soudanensis sp. nov.; Soudan Iron Mine sediment; polyphasic taxonomy 1. Introduction
Although deep subsurface environments are characterized by relatively low available organic carbon and elevated pressure, they are the largest habitats for prokaryotes, estimated to contain from 12% to 20% of the total biomass of microorganisms on Earth [1,2]. The deep biosphere contains a variety of functionally active microbial communities, but microbes face challenges such as limited available electron donors or acceptors, pore space, and fracture networks, and competition with other microorganisms for growth [3]. The Soudan Iron Mine is located in northern Minnesota, USA, along the southern edge of the Canadian Shield Transects and the Archaean Animikie ocean basin. The mine reaches a depth of 714 m below the surface, providing access to deep subsurface brines entrained in a massive hematite formation [3,4]. Previous cultivation-based and metagenomics studies reported the presence of diverse microbial communities, including the iron-oxidizing Marinobacter and iron-reducing Desulfuromonas in a calcium- and sodium-rich brine that reaches salinities as high as 4.2% (w/v) from these boreholes [3,5,6].
Halophiles and halotolerant bacteria are able to survive even in highly saline environments that are unfavorable for the existence of most life forms [7]. In recent decades, halophilic and halotolerant bacteria have been studied in biotechnological applications [8]. Halophiles have stable enzymes that function in high salinity and are used in industrial processes where high salt concentrations would inhibit enzymatic transformations [9]. Many compounds synthesized by halophiles (e.g., enzymes, polysaccharides, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and biosurfactants) are available for commercial uses [10,11,12,13]. Several halophilic enzymes, including proteases, amylases, lipases, and xylanases, have been characterized in recent years and are used in biofuel production [14], food processing [15], and the biodegradation of organic contaminants [16,17]. These halophilic and halotolerant bacteria are spread over a large number of phylogenetic branches, with most species being grouped in Proteobacteria [18].
The genus Martelella was originally described in 2005 by Rivas et al., isolated from a subterranean saline lake [19]. This genus belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, the class Alphaproteobacteria, the order Hyphomicrobiales, and the family Aurantimonadaceae (Available online: https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/martelella (accessed on 16 July 2021)). Thus far, a total of 8 species were reported in this genus: Martelella mediterranea [19], Martelella endophytica [20], Martelella radicis [21], Martelella mangrovi [21], Martelella suaedae [22], Martelella limonii [22], Martelella caricis [23], and Martelella lutilitoris [24]. The members of Martelella are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and chemoheterotrophic bacteria. Martelella strains were isolated from diverse environments such as a saline lake, the roots or mud plat of halophytes, and the soils of mangrove roots [19,20,21,22,23,24]. Additionally, a halophilic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading strain was reported [25]. Therefore, this genus could be of great biotechnological interest, as halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms are well-known for their potential applications in biotechnology.
Here, we report the taxonomic characterization of bacterial strains, NC18T and NC20, isolated from mine sediment by using polyphasic approaches.
2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Enrichment Culture and Isolation Strains NC18T and NC20 were isolated from sediment near a descending exploratory borehole (47°49.2′ N, 92°14.5′ W), Soudan Mine Diamond Drill Hole 942, located at the bottom (level 27) of the Soudan Underground Mine State Park in Soudan, Minnesota, USA. The sediment sample was serially diluted with 0.85% NaCl, and suspensions were plated on R2A agar (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 2% NaCl (w/v) and incubated at room temperature for 7 days. Circular, smooth, and white-to-cream-colored colonies of designated strains NC18T and NC20 were isolated and subsequently purified three times. Cultures were maintained on R2A plates supplemented with 2% NaCl at 30 °C, and stocks were preserved in R2A broth with glycerol (20%, v/v) at −80 °C.
2.2. Phenotypic Analysis Cell morphology and flagellation of strains NC18T and NC20 were observed by transmission electron microscope (CM20, Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) operated at 80 kV with cells grown in a marine agar (MA; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) plate for 2 days at 30 °C. Cells were negatively stained using 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, air-dried, and had their grids examined. The presence of spores was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy (ECLIPSE 80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at a magnification of 1500×, using cells that had been grown for 1 week at 30 °C on MA. Gram staining was determined by using the bioMérieux Gram-staining kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The colony color and morphology of strains NC18T and NC20 were investigated on MA plate incubated for 2 days at 30 °C.
Growth at different temperature (4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C) and pH (pH 4.0–10.0 at intervals of 1.0 pH units) levels were tested on marine broth 2216 (MB; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). pH was adjusted with 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N HCl solutions and checked after autoclaving. Salt tolerance was investigated in marine broth supplemented with 0–15% (w/v, at 1% intervals) NaCl. Growth of strains NC18T and NC20 at different temperatures, pH, and NaCl concentrations were determined by OD600 using a spectrophotometric method (Optizen POP, Mechasus, Daejeon, Korea). Growth under anaerobic conditions was determined on MA plates at 30 °C for 10 days in an anaerobic Gaspak jar (OXOID) with Anaero-PACK (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Catalase activity was determined with 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. Casein hydrolysis was examined on MA supplemented with 1% (w/v) skim milk. Enzyme activities, acid production from different carbohydrates, and the assimilation of various substrates were determined using API ZYM, API 20E, and API 20NE, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France).
2.3. Chemotaxonomic Analysis For the analysis of cellular fatty acid and respiratory quinone, cells of NC18T and NC20 were prepared from cells grown on MA for 2 days at 30 °C. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and analyzed according to the standard MIDI protocol (Sherlock Microbial Identification System, version 6.2) and identified by the RTSBA 6.0 database of the Microbial Identification System [26].
Respiratory quinone was extracted by the chloroform-methanol extraction method and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described [27].
2.4. Phylogenetic Analysis Genomic DNA was prepared using an AccuPrep Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was precipitated using 1 volume of chilled isopropanol and 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, followed by overnight incubation at −20 °C. DNA pellet was collected by centrifugation at 13,800× g for 30 min at 4 °C. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).
The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal primers 27F and 1492R [28]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences (1482 nt) of strains NC18T and NC20 were identical with the corresponding region of its genomic sequence and were compared with the related sequences from the EzBioCloud server (Available online: www.ezbiocloud.net (accessed on 16 July 2021)) [29]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned with those of closely related species using the CLUSTAL X software program [30]. Gaps were edited in the BioEdit program [31] using the neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood algorithms in MEGA 6.0 software [32]. Bootstrap analysis was performed to determine confidence values of individual branches in the phylogenetic tree with 1000 replications. The 16s rRNA gene sequences of strains NC18T and NC20 were deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers MT367774 and MT367775, respectively.
Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was also conducted to support phylogenetic analysis using 31 housekeeping gene products: dnaG, frr, infC, nusA, pgk, pyrG, rplA, rplB, rplC, rplD, rplE, rplF, rplK, rplL, rplM, rplN, rplP, rplS, rplT, rpmA, rpoB, rpsB, rpsC, rpsE, rpsI, rpsJ, rpsK, rpsM, rpsS, smpB, and tsf. The available genomic data of the genus Martelella were obtained from the GeneBank database (Supplementary Table S1). Then, 31 universally conserved proteins were extracted using the AmphoraNet server [33]. A multiple alignment of 31core proteins was built using MUSCLE [34]. The resulting alignment was concatenated using MEGA 6.0 [32], resulting in 9333 amino acid positions. Gaps were then removed using Gblocks version 0.91b [35], resulting in 4988 amino acid positions, covering about 53% of the original alignment. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by using the neighbor-joining, maximum-likelihood, and maximum-parsimony algorithms with the JTT matrix-based model [36] and 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA 6.0 [32].
2.5. Whole-Genome Sequencing, Assembly, and Annotation Whole-genome sequencing and assembly were carried out using Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II platforms at the ChunLab Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Illumina sequencing data were assembled with SPAdes 3.9.0 (Available online: http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/ (accessed on 5 December 2020)). MiSeq sequencing data were quality-controlled with Trimmomatic 0.36, and PhiX sequences were removed with BBMap 38.32. PacBio RS II sequencing data were assembled with PacBio SMRT Link 7.0.1 using the HGAP4 protocol (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Hybrid assembly was performed by Pilon version 1.22 and reassembled using quality-controlled MiSeq data and assembled contigs from Pacbio data. The resulting contigs from the hybrid assembly were circularized using Circlator 1.4.0 (Sanger Institute). Contamination of the whole-genome sequence was checked using ContEst16S [37]. Gene prediction and functional annotation pipeline of whole-genome assemblies used in EzBioCloud database. Protein coding sequences (CDSs) were predicted by Prodigal v.2.6.2 [38]. Genes coding for tRNA were identified using tRNAscan SE 1.3.1 [39]. rRNA operons were predicted by a covariance model search with Rfam 12.0 database [40]. CRISPRs were detected by PilerCR 1.06 [41] and CRT 1.2 [42]. Identified protein coding sequences (CDSs) were classified into clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) on the basis of their roles, with reference to orthologous groups (EggNOG 4.5; Available online: http://eggnogdb.embl.de (accessed on 20 December 2020)) [43]. For more functional annotation, the predicted CDSs were compared with Swissprot [44], KEGG [45], and SEED [46] databases using UBLAST [47]. The genomic sequences of strains NC18T and NC20 were deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accession numbers CP054858-CP054860 and CP054861-CP054863, respectively.
2.6. Comparative Genomic Analysis DNA G + C contents of strains NC18T and NC20 were calculated from the whole-genome sequence. Overall genome relatedness index (OGRI) of strains NC18T, NC20, and reference strains with available genomic sequences, M. mediterranea DSM 17316T (GenBank assembly accession GCA_002043005.1), M. endophytica YC6887T (GCA_000960975.1), and M. lutilitoris GH2-6T (GCA_005924265.1) were estimated on the basis of average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the ANI calculator employing the OrthoANIu algorithm [48] and digital DNA–DNA hybridizations (dDDH) values using the genome-to-genome distance-calculation (GGDC) method [49]. An online calculator GGDC2.1; available online: http://ggdc.dsmz.de/ggdc.php# (accessed on20 May 2021) was used for calculating the dDDH value with recommended Formula 2 [50]. Identified CDSs were classified into groups on the basis of their roles according to the reference to orthologous groups (EggNOG available online: http://eggnogdb.embl.de (accessed on 20 May 2021) [43]. To calculate the similarity at the orthologous protein level between genomes, given that average amino acid sequences change more slowly than nucleotide sequences do, two-way average amino acid identity (AAI), which is more sensitive over greater evolutionary distances, based on reciprocal best hits, was calculated using the AAI calculator available online: http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/aai (accessed on 20 May 2021) [51]. The Bacterial Pan-Genome Analysis Tool (BPGA) pipeline [52] was used to define core (shared with all five strains), accessory (shared with more than two but not all strains), and unique (strain-specific) pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs) of the five Martelella strains. POG clustering was carried out using the USEARCH algorithm with an identity value of 0.5.
3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Phenotypic Characterization Cells of strains NC18T and NC20 were short rod-shaped (0.8–0.9 × 1.2–1.3 μm and 0.8–1.1 × 1.2–2.5 μm, respectively; Supplementary Figure S1), Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and oxidase-, and catalase-positive. The colonies of the two strains were cream-colored, smooth, convex, and circular.
Phenotypic examination revealed several common traits between the novel strains and closely related type strains. However, strains NC18T and NC20 could be clearly differentiated from type strains by their ability to maximally grow in a higher NaCl concentration (13%); the ability for L-rhamnose fermentation-oxidation; the presence of urease; the absence of aesculin hydrolysis and acetoin production; and the inability for esterase lipase activity. Strain NC18T could also be differentiated from strain NC20 by its ability to optimally grow at pH 7; ability to maximally grow at a temperature of 40 °C and the presence of β-glucosidase; and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activity. The detailed morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of strains NC18T and NC20 are given in Table 1; the species description is in Section 4.1. Thus, the distinguished phenotypic properties suggest that strains NC18T and NC20 are separated from other species of the genus Martelella.
3.2. Chemotaxonomic Characterization Predominant cellular fatty acids of strain NC18T were summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c, 37.5%), C19:0 cyclo ω8c (25.8%), C16:0 (13.0%), C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl (6.4%), C18:0 (6.2%), and summed feature 2 (C12:0 ALDE, an unidentified fatty acid with an equivalent chain-length of 10.9525, iso-C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3-OH; 5.9%) (Table 2). The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain NC20 were summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c, 35.0%), C19:0 cyclo ω8c (28.2%), C16:0 (13.4%), C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl (6.6%), C18:0 (6.3%), and summed feature 2 (C12:0 ALDE, an unidentified fatty acid with an equivalent chain-length of 10.9525, iso-C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3-OH; 5.6%) (Table 2). The fatty acid profiles of strains NC18T and NC20 had similar patterns to those of members of the genus Martelella. However, there were some differences in the respective compositions of some long-chain fatty acids, such as C18:1 ω5c, C19:0 iso, and C20:1 ω7c. The respiratory quinones of strains NC18T and NC20 were Q-10, typical for the genus Martelella [1,2,3,4,5,6].
3.3. Phylogenetic Characterization The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains NC18T and NC20 were 1482 bp, showing 100% similarity to each other. NC18T and NC20 showed the highest sequence similarity values with those of M. mediterranea DSM 17316T (99.0%), M. limonii YC7034T (98.6%), M. endophytica YC6887T (98.1%), M. mangrovi BM9-1T (97.9%), M. lutilitoris GH2-6T (97.9%), M. suaedae YC7033T (97.6%), M. radicis BM5-7T (97.6%), and M. caricis GH2-8T (97.2%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities indicated that strain M. mediterranea DSM 17316T and M. limonii YC7034T were the nearest phylogenetic neighbors to the novel isolate. The 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic analysis based on the neighbor-joining (Figure 1), maximum-likelihood (Supplementary Figure S2), and maximum-parsimony (Supplementary Figure S3) algorithms indicated that strains NC18T and NC20 formed a lineage within the clade of the genus Martelella and separated it from the clade composed of the species M. mediterranea and M. limonii.
The MLSA tree also agreed with the taxonomic positions of the two strains as shown by the phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA gene (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures S4 and S5).
3.4. General Genomic Features The genomic features of strains NC18T and NC20 are shown in Table 3. The genome sizes of NC18T and NC20 were 6,109,459 and 6,109,677 bp, respectively. The NC18T genome was predicted to have 5849 genes, 5502 protein-encoding genes, 6 rRNAs, and 48 tRNAs. The NC20 genome was predicted to have 5830 genes, 5585 protein-encoding genes, 6 rRNAs, and 48 tRNAs.
The DNA G + C contents of both NC18T and NC20 were 61.8 mol% (Table 1), which are within the known DNA G + C contents of genus Martelella (52.8–62.6 mol%). The predicted functional genes based on the COG database of both strains mainly belong to amino acid transport and metabolism (E; 537 and 526 orthologs for NC18T and NC20, respectively), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G; 534 and 524 orthologs), transcription (K; 500 and 496 orthologs), and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P; 458 and 451 orthologs), except only a general function prediction (R) (Supplementary Table S2).
3.5. Comparative Genomic Characterization ANI, AAI, and dDDH values between NC18T and NC20 were 99.9%, 100%, and 100%, respectively (Table 4 and Table 5). These indicate that the two isolates belonged to a single species. In contrast, ANI values between NC18T and the reference strains of M. mediterranea DSM 17316T, M. endophytica YC6887T, and M. lutilitoris GH2-6T were 88.1%, 80.2%, and 80.4%, respectively (Table 4). AAI values between NC18T and the reference strains of M. mediterranea DSM 17316T, M. endophytica YC6887T, and M. lutilitoris GH2-6T were 87.7%, 76.3%, and 77.8%, respectively (Table 5). These ANI and AAI values were lower than the 95% threshold used to identify isolates as belonging to the same bacterial species [53,54]. The dDDH values of strain NC18T and the reference strains of M. mediterranea DSM 17316T, M. endophytica YC6887T, and M. lutilitoris GH2-6T were 34.9%, 23.9%, and 23.7%, respectively (Table 4), which were below the threshold of 70% for species delineation [53]. Altogether, these results indicate that strain NC18T represents a novel species of the genus Martelella.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the intra-species genomic diversity of the Martelella species, pan-genome analysis was performed. The pan-genome curve showed that the size of the pan-genome increased with the addition of new genomes (Supplementary Figure S6). The core genome slowly decreased as the genomes were added one by one. Pan-genomic analysis shows that the two strains and three related species had 8470 POGs: 2258 POG core, 3617 POG accessory, and 2595 POG unique (Figure 3). The five strains contained a certain number of strain-specific genes (POG unique), and the number varied considerably (9–971) depending on each strain, showing that the changing genetic flow led to the generation of strain specificity (Supplementary Table S3). Most of the POG core was classified into basic functions: amino acid transport and metabolism (E), general function prediction only (R), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (J), and transcription (K) (Supplementary Figure S7), which were related to necessary nutrients obtaining from various environments and maintaining a lifestyle. Function unknown (S) occupied a large proportion, which showed the current lacing in understanding Martelella genomes. Most of the POG accessory was also classified as a similar pattern to that of the POG core.
In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the POG unique were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism, especially carbohydrate metabolism (Supplementary Figure S8), which corresponded with the variable ability of carbon source use tested by API (Table 1). These genomic characteristics indicated the diversity of metabolic pathways in different Martelella strains. In addition, the concatenated POG core-based phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Figure S9) showed that the two novel strains were distinct from the three other Martelella strains, as clustering with M. mediterranea DSM 17316T.
This result was consistent with the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains NC18T and NC20 with other related taxa. Thus, the distinguished genetic distinctiveness by ANI, AAI, and dDDH values suggest that strain NC18T is separated from other recognized species of the genus Martelella. Pan-genomic analysis also showed the distinct patterns of gene content and metabolism pathway within this new Martelella species.
4. Conclusions We isolated two Martelella strains and performed phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and genomic analyses to identify these strains as novel species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains NC18T and NC20 grouped with members of the genus Martelella, including M. mediterranea DSM 17316T and M. limonii YC7034T. Genetic distinctiveness by ANI, AAI, and dDDH values suggested that strains NC18T and NC20 are separated from other recognized species of the genus Martelella. Pan-genomic analysis showed that most POG cores of NC18T and NC20 were relevant to amino acid transport and metabolism in the COG category and carbohydrate metabolism in the KEGG pathway. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic data, strain NC18T represents the type strain of a novel species of the genus Martelella, for which the name Martelella soudanensis sp. nov. is proposed.
