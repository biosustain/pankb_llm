Phylotaxogenomics for the Reappraisal of the Genus Roseomonas With the Creation of Six New Genera
The genus Roseomonas is a significant group of bacteria which is invariably of great clinical and ecological importance. Previous studies have shown that the genus Roseomonas is polyphyletic in nature. Our present study focused on generating a lucid understanding of the phylogenetic framework for the re-evaluation and reclassification of the genus Roseomonas. Phylogenetic studies based on the 16S rRNA gene and 92 concatenated genes suggested that the genus is heterogeneous, forming seven major groups. Existing Roseomonas species were subjected to an array of genomic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic analyses in order to resolve the heterogeneity. Genomic similarity indices (dDDH and ANI) indicated that the members were well-defined at the species level. The Percentage of Conserved Proteins (POCP) and the average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) values between the groups of the genus Roseomonas and other interspersing members of the family Acetobacteraceae were below 65 and 70%, respectively. The pan-genome evaluation depicted that the pan-genome was an open type and the members shared 958 core genes. This claim of reclassification was equally supported by the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic differences between the groups. Thus, in this study, we propose to re-evaluate and reclassify the genus Roseomonas and propose six novel genera as Pararoseomonas gen. nov., Falsiroseomonas gen. nov., Paeniroseomonas gen. nov., Plastoroseomonas gen. nov., Neoroseomonas gen. nov., and Pseudoroseomonas gen. nov.
Introduction The genus Roseomonas comes under the family Acetobacteraceae, the class Alphaproteobacteria, and the phylum Proteobacteria (Rihs et al., 1993). Altogether, there are 46 validly published genera names under the family Acetobacteraceae to date.1 Members of the genus Roseomonas are metabolically diverse and prevalent (Rihs et al., 1993; Han et al., 2003). They may have fundamental functions in supporting various ecological and biogeographical processes. They are highly ubiquitous and have been widely isolated from clinical specimens like blood, wounds, and genitourinary samples (Bibashi et al., 2000; Han et al., 2003) and environmental samples like contaminated oil sediments (Subhash and Lee, 2018), water (Gallego et al., 2006), soil (Kim and Ka, 2014), and air (Kim et al., 2013). Members of this genus are aerobic, Gram-negative, pink pigmented, and non-fermentative (Rihs et al., 1993). At the time of writing, the genus Roseomonas comprised 45 validly described species names and two sub-species names.2 The genus Roseomonas was first described by Rihs et al. (1993). The type species of this genus is Roseomonas gilardii (Rihs et al., 1993) and the species name was validated in the year 1998. “Roseomonas aceris” (Tonouchi and Tazawa, 2014), “Roseomonas baikalica” (Andreeva et al., 2007), “Roseomonas chloroacetimidivorans” (Chu et al., 2016), and “Candidatus Roseomonas massiliae” (Greub et al., 2004) are not valid names. “Roseomonas hellenica” was described recently (Rat et al., 2021). Furthermore, R. fauriae, described by Rihs et al. (1998), is a later heterotypic synonym of Azospirillum brasilense (Tarrand et al., 1978; Helsel et al., 2006).
Phylotaxogenomics of the class Alphaproteobacteria was extensively studied recently by Hördt et al. (2020), which showed that several taxa under it, including the members of the family Acetobacteraceae, were disordered. One of the major discussions under this communication is the re-evaluation of the phylogenetic relationships between the members of the genus Roseomonas. This is based on the fact that the genus Roseomonas was distinctly polyphyletic with members like Roseomonas stagni and Roseomonas lacus interspersed in between other sister groups of Humitalea and Rubritepida in the family Acetobacteraceae (Hördt et al., 2020). Furthermore, the same study revealed that Rhodovarius lipocyclicus nested within the genus Roseomonas based on the constrained comprehensive tree (CCT) (Hördt et al., 2020). Likewise, a study conducted by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016) depicted that the members of the genus Roseomonas were organized into seven different clades based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and ecology.
Ambiguity has emerged due to the poor discriminatory power of the16S rRNA gene marker for absolute resolution at the genus/species level (Fox et al., 1992; Janda and Abbott, 2007; Olm et al., 2020). Over the decade, meaningful deductions of unresolved and longstanding phylogenetic relationships between members of the genera like Mycobacterium (Gupta et al., 2018), Corallococcus (Livingstone et al., 2018), Roseobacter (Wirth and Whitman, 2018), Rhodobacter (Suresh et al., 2019), and Lactobacillus (Wittouck et al., 2019) have been worked out well. This resolution has been successfully elucidated owing to the robust calculated parameters and integrated comparative genomics that included average amino acid identity (AAI), average nucleotide identity (ANI), genomic signatures, and pan-genome analysis (McInerney et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited the current status of the genus Roseomonas based on definite and congruent genomic evidence. Here, on the basis of phylogenomic studies like phylogenetic, pan-genomic, and taxogenomic analysis, we have proposed to re-classify the genus Roseomonas into Roseomonas genus sensu-stricto along with six novel genera (gen. nov.).
Materials and Methods Genome Sequences and Phylogenetic Analysis The genome sequences affiliated to the family Acetobacteraceae, which were available publicly at the NCBI and JGI databases, were retrieved (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 34 type strains and 28 other related strains affiliated to the genus Roseomonas were considered in this study (Table 1). As the genome sequence of the type species of the genus Roseomonas was not available at the time of writing, R. gilardii subsp. rosea was taken as a representative for the type species in this analysis.
For the phylogenetic analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all the validly published species names, effectively but not validly published names like “R. aceris” R-1T, “R. chloroacetimidivorans” BUT-13T, and “candidatus Roseomonas massiliae” of the genus Roseomonas, were taken from the NCBI database. For Roseomonas aquatica and Roseomomas fluminis, cloned sequences were also taken to understand the phylogenetic position and confirm their status within the genus Roseomonas. In addition, the 16S rRNA gene sequences of representative members and cloned sequences of 11 other genera affiliated to the family of Acetobacteraceae were also accounted for the phylogenetic analysis. The 16S rRNA sequence of Elioraea tepidiphila DSM 17972T was used as an outgroup. MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004) of MEGA7 was used for sequence alignments and the phylogenetic analysis of the sequences was performed using MEGA7 (Kumar et al., 2016). Distances were calculated using Kimura two-parameter in a deletion manner (Kimura, 1980). Neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML), and maximum parsimony (MP) methods in the MEGA7 software were used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Percentage support values were obtained using a bootstrap procedure (Felsenstein, 1985).
As for the phylogenomic tree reconstruction, 62 genomes of members of the genus Roseomonas (34 type strains, 28 other related strains) and 135 genomes representative of 43 other genera of the family Acetobacteraceae (as per the NCBI database) were considered for the phylogenomic study (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 92 core genes were identified in 197 genomes and were retrieved for phylogenomic analysis using the Up-to-date Bacterial Core Gene (UBCG) tool (Na et al., 2018). The genes considered for the phylogenomic tree analysis are given in Supplementary Table 2, and Stella humosa DSM 5900T was used as an outgroup. The RAXML-based phylogenomic tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of the 92 core genes of 197 genomes.
Analysis of Core and Pan-Genome Bacterial Pan-genome Analysis (BPGA) pipeline (Chaudhari et al., 2016) was applied for the analysis of the genomic diversity of Roseomonas. The default parameters were set to check the conserved, accessory, and strain-specific genomic traits between the members of the genus Roseomonas. The same process was also carried out for each of the proposed genera (n ≥ 3) in this study.
Genomic Similarity Indices Robust parameters like average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) were computed for the precise delineation of the members of the genus Roseomonas. Whereas, AAI and Percentage of Conserved Proteins (POCP) values were calculated within the members of the genus Roseomonas as well as with the members of the other genera in the family Acetobactereaceae. OrthoANI tool (Yoon et al., 2017) and Genome-to-Genome Distance calculator 2.13 (Auch et al., 2010) were used for calculating the ANI and dDDH values, respectively. AAI was calculated using the AAI calculator developed by Kostas lab4 (Rodriguez and Konstantinidis, 2014). POCP was calculated as described by Qin et al. (2014). The obtained AAI and POCP values were used to construct a heatmap using an online tool, Morpheus,5 and were clustered hierarchically based on the Euclidean distance.
Functional and Metabolic Annotations The identification and annotation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BCGs) for the members of the genus Roseomonas were carried out with the antiSMASH 5.0 web server (Blin et al., 2019) which applies the Hidden Markov Models for the identification of BCGs. For the detection, strictness level was set to “relaxed.” Genomes were submitted to the KBase online software (Arkin et al., 2018)6 using the default parameters to generate genomic data which were later manually analyzed to gather the group-specific gene clusters.
Virulence Factors and Pathogen-Associated Genes To understand the pathogenicity of the members of the genus Roseomonas, genomes were submitted individually to the IslandViewer 4 server (Bertelli et al., 2017) in the .gbk format where Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 was given as the reference genome. Virulence factors were also checked by submitting the genome sequences (.fas format) to the VirulenceFinder 2.07 hosted by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) against four genera of Listeria, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus. The threshold for percent identity (%ID) between input and matching gene in the database was 90% with a minimum length of 60%.
Phenotypic and Chemotaxonomic Characters Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization of each described species for taxon delineation was obtained from the original species descriptions, Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Weyant and Whitney, 2005), and from other references as specified.
Results Phylogenetic Analysis Based on the 16S rRNA Gene and Genome Sequence The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic tree showed that the genus Roseomonas was polyphyletic and was segregated into seven major clades (Figure 1). These seven major clades were defined as Groups I–VII on the basis of the clade formation. The validly described members of each of the clade were as follows: Group I (n = 4), Group II (n = 8), Group III (n = 10), Group IV (n = 2), Group V (n = 2), Group VI (n = 7), and Group VII (n = 16) (Figure 1). Group I shall be considered as Roseomonas genus sensu stricto. The pairwise 16S rRNA gene identity was calculated using the pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment for taxonomy.8 The members of a group delineated by the phylogenetic tree shared at least 93.5–99.2% of the 16S rRNA gene identity (Supplementary Table 3).
The phylogenomic tree was reconstructed using 92 core genes (Supplementary Table 2) of 197 genomes by the UBCG tool (Na et al., 2018). The study by Na et al. (2018) showed that these 92 core genes (Supplementary Table 2) were found as a single copy in more than 95% of the genome sequences. Furthermore, the UBCG-based phylogenomic tree (92 genes) could separate E. coli/Shigella spp. better than the 16S rRNA gene alone (Na et al., 2018). UBCG-based phylogenomic tree (Figure 2) further confirmed the heterogeneity of the genus Roseomonas. Genome sequences were not available for the members of Group IV including R. aquatica and R. fluminis. Furthermore, as per this study, Roseomonas aeriglobus and a genomospecies of Roseomonas cladded outside of the family Acetobacteraceae. Therefore, the genomes of these members were not considered for further study.
Genomic Features of Roseomonas spp. The genome information of the type strains used in this study are given in Table 1. Groups I (n = 11), II (n = 9), III (n = 8), V (n = 3), VI (n = 12), and VII (n = 17) have genome sizes of 4.1–5.4 Mbp, 4.9–6.5 Mbp, 5.8–6.7 Mbp, 4.4–7.2 Mbp, 4.2–6.4 Mbp, and 4.5–6.3 Mbp, respectively (Table 1). The genomic G+C content (mol%) of the taxa belonging to Groups I (n = 11), II (n = 9), III (n = 8), V (n = 3), VI (n = 12), and VII (n = 17) were 70.1–70.9%, 68.7–71.9%, 70.3–71.7%, 69.5–69.7%, 68.7–72.7%, and 68.6–71.9%, respectively (Table 1). On the average taxa between the groups, Group I had the lowest and Group V had the highest genome size of 4.8 and 6.3 Mbp, respectively. Similarly, the lowest (69.6 mol%) average genomic G+C content was observed with the taxa of Group V, whereas the highest (71.2 mol%) was observed with the taxa of Group VI. When the genome size of the members of the genus Roseomonas was compared with the taxa of the other genera in the family Acetobacteraceae, Dankookia (n = 1) had the highest genome size of 7.8 Mbp. On the contrary, the genus Rubritepida (n = 1) had the lowest genome size of 3.8 Mbp with the highest (73.4 mol%) genomic G+C (Table 1).
Analysis of Core and Pan-Genome of the Genus Roseomonas To examine the distribution of genes and genomic diversity across the genus Roseomonas, genome sequences were given as input in the BPGA tool. The analyzed data of the genus Roseomonas are given in Supplementary Table 4. Genus Roseomonas members have 958 core genes (19.1%), 219,753 accessory genes (72.8%), and 24,320 strain-specific genes (8.1%) (Figure 3A). For the diagrammatic representation of the pan-genome for the genus Roseomonas, only the type strains were considered. The core-pan plot (Figure 3B) showed an open pan-genome for the genus Roseomonas as it did not level off into a plateau and extended with the increase in the number of genomes. The core genome was conserved at the genus level as the plot leveled off. The KEGG distribution (%) of genes based on function is illustrated in Figure 3C for the genus Roseomonas. Members of Groups I, II, III, V, VI, and VII had core genes between the range of 1,573–3,152 (Supplementary Table 4). The diagrammatic representation of the core and pan genome plot for each of the group are given in Supplementary Figures 1A–F. For each of the group, the KEGG distribution (%) of genes based on function is illustrated in Supplementary Figures 2A–F.
Genomic Metrics—dDDH, ANI, AAI, and POCP At an intra-group level, members of a group (consisting both type and non-type strains) defined by phylotaxogenomics shared dDDH and ANI values of at least 21–100% and 78.0–99.9%, respectively (Supplementary Table 5). At an inter-group level, members of different groups did not show dDDH and ANI values above 20.8 and 76.8%, respectively. POCP and AAI values were calculated between the members of the groups (intra-group) as well as at the inter-group level (Supplementary Tables 6, 7) as they are considered pivotal and accurate for genus delineation (Qin et al., 2014). POCP values for Group I (n = 11), Group II (n = 9), Group III (n = 8), Group V (n = 3), Group VI (n = 12), and Group VII (n = 17) taxa were 80–98.5%, 65.2–71.7%, 66.9–98.7%, 65.8–99.3%, 66.4–99.2%, and 65.2–99.4%, respectively. While the AAI values were 91.9–99.0%, 76.7–84.8%, 71.8–99.9%, 73.8–99.9%, 77.0–99.9%, and 70.2–99.9% for the taxa of the respective groups. The POCP and AAI heatmaps (Supplementary Figures 3, 4) support the division of the six groups. The AAI values between Roseomonas fauriae (later heterotypic synonym of Azospirillum brasilense) and the members of Group I are in between 51.2 and 51.5%, thus making them distinct species under different genera.
Functional and Metabolic Annotations The BCGs prediction based on the antiSMASH 5.0 web server indicated an average Roseomonas genome consisted of seven BCGs (420 BCGs were found in 60 genomes). Group I (n = 11) members had 65 BCGs (clustered into 11 types of BCG families); Group II (n = 9), 72 (19 BCGs families); Group III (n = 8), 59 (13 BCG families); Group V (n = 3), 35 (9 BCG families); Group VI (n = 12), 68 (14 BCG families); and Group VII (n = 17), 124 (24 BCG families) (Supplementary Table 8). Terpenes were the most prevalent ones (two per genome on an average) but also an average of one type1 polyketide synthases (TPKS) per genome. The members of Group I exclusively had non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), beta-lactone (fengymycin), and thioamitides (asukamycin). The members of Groups I and II both had phosphonate/terpene (phosphinothricintripeptide) BCG. All the members of Group II possessed a redox-cofactor BCG, whereas the members of both Groups II and III shared type 3 polyketide synthases (T3PKS). Group V members had NRPS/T1PKS and arylpolene BCGs. As for Group VI, eight genomes (out of 17) had NRPS and five genomes had arylpolene (xanthomonadin) BCGs. As for the Group VII, four genomes had unique ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) BCG exclusively.
The genome annotation showed that 226, 58, and 82 gene clusters were unique to Groups I, II, and III, respectively (Supplementary Table 9). Members of Group V comprised of 67 unique gene clusters, Group VI consisted of 74 unique gene clusters, and Group VII comprised16 unique gene clusters (Supplementary Table 9). As predicted by the IslandViewer 4 server and VirulenceFinder 2.0, the draft genomes of the members of the genus Roseomonas did not possess any genes related to its pathogenicity and virulence.
Phenotypic and Chemotaxonomic Characters Between the Groups Correlation between the genomic studies and phenotypic characters are desirable for supporting taxa delineation. Members of Groups II and VI can be distinguished from those of Group V by being non-motile. Members of Groups II and III can be differentiated from those of Groups I, IV, V, VI, and VII in showing variable catalase activity. Members of Groups I and II show variable oxidase activity, whereas members of the other groups are either oxidase positive (Groups III, VI, VII) or negative (Groups IV, V). Members of Groups VI and VII have a high NaCl tolerance than members of the other groups. NaCl tolerance was used as a differentiating taxonomic character for delineating the genus Swaminathania biochemically from the other genera of the family Acetobacteraceae like Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Kozakia (Loganathan and Nair, 2004). Members of Groups II and III were variable for starch hydrolysis, while those of Groups IV, V, VI, and VII were negative. Members of Group VI were variably positive for casein hydrolysis, whereas members of the rest of the groups were negative. Members of Groups I, IV, and VI were urease positive, whereas members of Groups II, III, and VII were variable in reaction. Members of Groups II, III, V, and VII showed a negative reaction for nitrate reduction, whereas those of the other groups were variable. Similarly, Groups II and III can be differentiated from the other groups in showing variable activity of gelatin hydrolysis. Group VII can be distinguished from Groups II, III, and IV in the positive utilization of D-glucose. Members of Groups V, VI, and VII could utilize L-arabinose for growth, whereas members of Groups II, III, and IV could not utilize the same. Members of Groups III, VI, and VII could utilize sucrose, whereas those of Groups IV and V were negative. Members of Group VI contained Q-9 as the unique respiratory quinone which differs from those of the other groups which contained Q-10. Groups III and VII members can be distinguished from those of Groups I, II, IV, V, and VI in having a glycolipid. Similarly, Groups V and VII can be distinguished from each other in having an unidentified lipid as one of the polar lipids. Analysis of polar lipids is a significant chemotaxonomic aid and has often been used as a differential character for reclassification. The phenotypic differentiating characteristics between the genus Roseomonas and other closely related genera of the family Acetobacteraceae are given in Table 2.
Discussion Genus Roseomonas has been widely studied as the members have clinical and environmental significances (Rihs et al., 1993; Han et al., 2003; Romano-Bertrand et al., 2016; Subhash et al., 2016). Six novel species names were validly published in the years 2020–2021 (see text footnote 2). The supremacy of the genomic era has identified whole-genome sequence data being more definitive and conclusive for taxa delineation than the 16S rRNA gene marker. Conventionally, a polyphasic approach was adopted for the demarcation of the Roseomonas species. As per the work conducted by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016), they showed that the genus Roseomonas was segregated into seven different clades based mainly on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and ecology. Likewise, the study carried out by Hördt et al. (2020) showed that the genus Roseomonas was polyphyletic and consequently called in for a major reclassification. Taxogenomics is considered more precise and superior for the taxa delineation as it strengthens data reproducibility and reliability (Chun and Rainey, 2014; Lalucat et al., 2020). To determine the absolute phylogenetic standing between the current members of genus Roseomonas, a comprehensive taxogenomic analysis was carried out.
The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic tree showed that the genus Roseomonas was polyphyletic and was segregated into seven major clades: Groups I to VII (Figure 1). The cladding patterns of Groups I, II, III, VI, and VII members in this study are comparable to the cladding pattern observed by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016) in terms of the species composition. Group IV member, R. aquatica (Group IV), cladded outside the designated clade observed by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016) whereas, R. fluminis which also belongs to this group was described later in 2018 by Ko et al. (2018). Furthermore, R. arctica (Group V) was shown to be affiliated to the R. stagni (Group III) clade, whereas “R. hellenica” is not included by them as it was described later (Rat et al., 2021). It was suggested that the whole genome phylogenies could provide a better resolution rather than a single gene like the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenies for taxonomic delineation (Logan et al., 2009). However, in the case of Roseomonas, the phylogenomic tree based on 92 concatenated genes also showed the same cladding pattern (Figure 2; except for Group IV for which the genome sequences are not available).
Nouioui et al. (2018) and Hördt et al. (2020) have shown that genome size variation can be applied as a reliable taxonomic marker. They showed that the genome size appeared to be genus-specific for the members of the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Alphaproteobacteria. Both studies implied that the genome size and G+C content (mol%) were phylogenetically conserved. Hence, the genome sizes have been formally added to the descriptions. In this context, Group I had the smallest genome size as compared to the other groups. Analysis of pan and core genomes using the BPGA pipeline illustrated that the pan-genome of the genus Roseomonas is open and consists of 958 core genes, summing up to 19.1% of the total pan-genome (Supplementary Table 3). As for the BCGs, only groups of the genus Roseomonas could produce specific secondary metabolites, i.e., NRPS, fengymycin, and asukamycic (Group I); redox-cofactor (Group II); and NRPS/T1PKS and arylpolene (Group V) (Supplementary Table 8). The genome annotation also revealed the composition of the gene clusters unique to each group with the highest number of clusters unique to Group I and lowest in Group VII (Supplementary Table 9).
Chun et al. (2018) have proposed minimum standards based on an overall genome-related index (OGRI) like dDDH and ANI for species delineation. Wayne et al. (1984) prescribed a cut-off of 70% dDDH value for species delineation. In the present scenario, ≥95% of ANI between the two strains concludes that both belong to the same species whereas for values <95%, two strains are considered as different species (<75% for different genera) (Richter and Rosselló-Móra, 2009; Rodriguez and Konstantinidis, 2014; Rosselló-Móra and Amann, 2015). Both indices (dDDH and ANI) are consistent at the intra-group level with the recommended standards confirming that all members of Roseomonas are well-described at the species level (Supplementary Table 3). For the POCP values, <50% were considered a cut-off for genera delineation (Qin et al., 2014). POCP values between the groups of the genus Roseomonas were <65% (40–65%) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 6) and with the other genera of the members of the family Acetobacteraceae were also <70% (20–60%) (Supplementary Table 6). Thus, for the species of the genus Roseomonas, the calculated values of POCP for genus delineation were not in agreement with the ones observed by Qin et al. (2014). Although a proposed genus boundary of the POCP value for prokaryotic lineages was assigned as 50%, many studies later showed exceptions at the inter-genera comparison. The universal cut-off of 50% is considered conservative, as being only an index of relatedness (Liu et al., 2020) as reflected in its ineffectiveness in delineating different genera of the family Methylococcaceae (Orata et al., 2018), Bacillaceae (Aliyu et al., 2016), Burkholderiaceae (Lopes-Santos et al., 2017), and Rhodobacteraceae (Wirth and Whitman, 2018). Luo et al. (2014) have shown that AAI values of related but different genera ranged from 60 to 80%. In our study, AAI values were below 70% between the different groups of the genus Roseomonas (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 7) and other genera members of the family Acetobacteraceae (Supplementary Table 7), hence in congruence with the work of Luo et al. (2014).
The study conducted by Hördt et al. (2020) showed that certain members of the genus Roseomonas like R. stagni were interspersed with H. rosea and R. lacus with Rubritepida flocculans. The distinction between the mentioned species pairs was clarified by the dDDH, ANI, AAI, and POCP values. dDDH, ANI, AAI, and POCP values between R. stagni and H. rosea and R. lacus and R. flocculans were 19.4, 74.1, 64.2, and 64.2 and 19.8, 74.8, 66.6, and 57.1%, respectively. Similarly, the study also showed that Rhodovarius lipocyclicus was nested within the genus Roseomonas (Hördt et al., 2020). However, R. lipocyclicus is a distinct member of the genus Rhodovarius from Roseomonas as the AAI and POCP values are 50.8–66.8% and 53.2–64.7%, respectively, below the recommended cut-off for genus delineation. Thus, the above indices clearly differentiate the Roseomonas species from the genera of Humitalea, Rubritepida, and Rhodovarius. Therefore, the above detailed discussion entails the formation of seven different groups within the genus Roseomonas in congruence with the findings given by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016) and Hördt et al. (2020).
Members of the genus Roseomonas have a ubiquitous distribution in the environment. Group I members were the only ones to have been isolated from a human blood sample (R. gilardii, R. mucosa, R. gilardii subsp. rosea) (Rihs et al., 1993; Han et al., 2003) except for R. elaeocarpi which was isolated from olive phyllosphere (Damtab et al., 2016). An examination of the literature demonstrated that the strains of Roseomonas have been widely reported in human infections and isolated from clinical samples like sputum, wounds, and genitourinary sites (Wallace et al., 1990; Rihs et al., 1993). It was also found to be associated with immunocompromised patients (Marin et al., 2001). Other reports of bacteremia caused by the Roseomonas species were in vertebral osteomyelitis (Nahass et al., 1995), infected tooth (Diesendorf et al., 2017), endocarditis (Shao et al., 2019), and peritonitis (Malini et al., 2016). However, many reports in case studies suggests that the majority of the patients had underlying diseases, malignancy being the most common factor (Wang et al., 2012; Michon et al., 2014). Pathogenic genes and virulence factors are potent segments of the genomic islands. They become part of the genome as a consequence of horizontal gene transfer, and these genes are observed to confer their pathogenicity and virulence to the bacteria (da Silva Filho et al., 2018). The above-mentioned reports can be substantiated with the predicted facts that the genomes of the members do not suggest any kind of genes responsible toward its pathogenicity and virulence. Thus, it may be concluded that Roseomonas strains are incidental and not causative of pathogenicity. In addition to being associated with human clinical samples, Roseomonas spp. were also isolated from various sources like soil (Kim and Ka, 2014), sediment (He et al., 2014), sludges (Wang et al., 2016), contaminated soil (Subhash and Lee, 2018), freshwater (Baik et al., 2012), and also human sources like blood (Rihs et al., 1993; Figure 1).
In an ecological context, the presence of accessory genes in the members shows their divergence due to environmental adaptations. The presence of accessory genes shows the acquisition of genes in response to the selective pressure (Brito et al., 2015) or for the colonization of the new ecological habitats (McInerney et al., 2017). The cosmopolitan distribution of the members of the groups may be attributed to the gain of accessory genes for their survival which in turn may be attributed to their variable genomic sizes, simple organization, or horizontal gene transfer rates (Kuo and Ochman, 2009; Aherfi et al., 2018). Also, the formation of ecotypes based on the varied isolation sources may not be feasible for groups of the genus Roseomonas. This is also evident from the distinctive genomic features observed during the pan-genome evaluation for each of the groups, which may have resulted in response to the environmental changes.
The extensive taxogenomics study performed substantiates the separation of the respective groups of the genus Roseomonas into separate genera as suggested by Romano-Bertrand et al. (2016) and Hördt et al. (2020). Considering the fact that Roseomonas is a very divergent genus, henceforth members of this genus cannot be clustered under one phylogenetic genus, necessitating the creation of six new genera. For each of the novel genera, emended description and reclassification are given. Phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1) and whole genome sequences (Figure 2) agree with the formation of seven different clades as separate genera. Although the 16S rRNA gene studies have certain drawbacks, this approach is still quite accountable for the delineation of the members of the genus Roseomonas. This study would be a first attempt in re-evaluating the genus Roseomonas and reclassifying it by creating six new genera: Group II as Pararoseomonas gen. nov., Group III as Falsiroseomonas gen. nov., Group IV as Paeniroseomonas gen. nov., Group V as Plastoroseomonas gen. nov., Group VI as Neoroseomonas gen. nov., and Group VII as Pseudoroseomonas gen. nov. The genus delineation for Group IV is based on the 16S rRNA gene analysis (in the absence of genome sequences) and phenotypic characteristics. The genus delineation constructed from the 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotypic characters provide sufficient resolution to distinguish the Group IV members from other groups of the genus Roseomonas. However, the availability of the genome sequences may further substantiate the reclassification in the future. The species within each of the newly defined genera have been defined accurately as per the recommended standards for ANI and dDDH (Supplementary Table 5). As for the genus delineation, the inter-group AAI and POCP values agree with the standards given for genus determination (Supplementary Tables 6, 7). The justification for genus delineation based on the 16S rRNA gene identity, AAI and POCP, and other phenotypic characters are given in Figure 4 and Table 2.
