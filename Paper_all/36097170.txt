Title: A bacterial pan-genome makes gene essentiality strain-dependent and evolvable
Abstract: Many bacterial species are represented by a pan-genome, whose genetic repertoire far outstrips that of any single bacterial genome. Here we investigate how a bacterial pan-genome might influence gene essentiality and whether essential genes that are initially critical for the survival of an organism can evolve to become non-essential. By using Transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq), whole-genome sequencing and RNA-seq on a set of 36 clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae strains representative of >68% of the species’ pan-genome, we identify a species-wide ‘essentialome’ that can be subdivided into universal, core strain-specific and accessory essential genes. By employing ‘forced-evolution experiments’, we show that specific genetic changes allow bacteria to bypass essentiality. Moreover, by untangling several genetic mechanisms, we show that gene essentiality can be highly influenced by and/or be dependent on: (1) the composition of the accessory genome, (2) the accumulation of toxic intermediates, (3) functional redundancy, (4) efficient recycling of critical metabolites and (5) pathway rewiring. While this functional characterization underscores the evolvability potential of many essential genes, we also show that genes with differential essentiality remain important antimicrobial drug target candidates, as their inactivation almost always has a severe fitness cost in vivo.
Body: No single gene operates in isolation; instead, they form elaborate networks of interacting components from which phenotypes emerge. Most genes in a genome are non-essential1. However, their degree of dispensability may depend on the genetic background and/or the composition of the environment. In contrast, essential genes are critical for growth and survival under any circumstance. This is reflected in their high level of conservation within and often across species, limited genetic diversity, and high and stable expression levels2, 3–4. Consequently, essential genes are considered rigid, largely immutable key components to an organism’s survival, which makes them attractive as antimicrobial targets5.
New insights are challenging this unyielding essential-gene concept. For instance, large-scale experiments in different yeast species have shown that genomic or transcriptional changes can suppress gene essentiality6, 7, 8–9. Additionally, many bacterial species are defined by a pan-genome. This means that different strains may contain distinct sets of genes, resulting in a species with a genetic repertoire that far exceeds that of any single genome. Moreover, a limited number of comparisons using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Interference (CRISPRi) and Tn-seq10,11 in E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa experimentally demonstrate that essentiality is sometimes strain-specific12,13. These data indicate that essentiality is a fluid concept probably influenced by both the environment and the genetic background1,6.
The human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and mortality14,15, is one species with a large pan-genome. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that a genome contains ~2,100 genes, while the entire species contains >4,000 genes16,17. By utilizing Tn-seq, we have shown that TIGR4, a common clinical and lab strain18,19, contains >250 essential genes. However, a Tn-seq analysis we performed in three diverse S. pneumoniae strains2,20 suggests that some essential genes are non-essential in at least one strain.
In this study, we assemble a detailed functional genomics dataset for a representative collection of 36 S. pneumoniae strains by performing: (1) single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT-seq), (2) RNA-seq and (3) Tn-seq. We show that the species contains 206 universally essential genes (always present and essential), 186 core strain-specific essential genes (always present but not always essential) and 128 accessory essential genes (essential when present). We show that these different essential-gene types have different (phenotypic) characteristics; we also use ‘forced-evolution’ experiments to determine how probable it is that a ‘solution’ exists for an essential gene to become non-essential. We show that while it is hard for a universal gene to lose its essentiality, core strain-specific and accessory essentials can switch to non-essentiality due to genetic background changes. Importantly, we show that differential essential genes remain important antimicrobial drug target candidates, as their deletion almost always has a fitness cost in vitro and in vivo.
A pan-genome (PG) collection was assembled, consisting of 36 S. pneumoniae strains. To obtain a single contig for each strain, 33 were re-sequenced with PacBio (Bioproject PRJNA514780). This collection represents 16 capsule serotypes and 17 clusters of the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project (GPS)21 (Supplementary Data 1). Six are commonly used experimental strains including D39 and TIGR418,22, while 30 strains are part of a larger S. pneumoniae surveillance collection23. Notably, these 30 strains consist of 15 genetically similar pairs (Supplementary Data 2), which should display similar phenotypes.
To determine the degree to which the PG collection reflects the S. pneumoniae pan-genome, a ‘pan-genome study group’ was created, consisting of 208 strains covering 64 different GPS clusters (Supplementary Data 3)21,24, 25, 26–27. Three different pan-genome analysis tools28, 29–30 were used to estimate the size of the pan-genome at >4,100 genes (all genes in the species) and a core genome of 1,349 genes (present in all strains), which is similar to previous estimates16,17 (Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Data 4 and 5). In-depth analyses indicate that the 36-strain PG collection scatters evenly through a phylogenetic tree, and is representative of the S. pneumoniae pan-genome by covering >68% of its genetic content (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Fig. 1a).
Tn-seq was employed to determine gene essentiality across the PG collection. Tn library construction was successful in 21 out of 36 strains. Variable transformation efficiency across strains affects this success and depends on both known and unknown factors, including capsule serotype31. Tn-seq predicts gene essentiality on the basis of library saturation (percentage of transposon-occupied thymidine-adenosine sites) and the lack of insertions in a gene. Out of 21 libraries, 17 had >35% saturation, enabling high-confidence essentiality predictions ranging from 274 (PG29) to 379 (PG02) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 6). From the high-confidence ‘essential’ category, the ‘essentialome’ is defined as consisting of 520 genes that are essential in at least one strain. Using gene cluster comparisons of essentiality predictions across strains, the essentialome is further subdivided into: (1) 206 universal essentials: core genome genes that are present and essential in each strain; (2) 186 core strain-dependent essentials: core genome genes that are present in all strains but only essential in some; and (3) 128 accessory essentials: accessory genome genes essential in strains where they are present (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 7). This categorization suggests that for a substantial number of genes, essentiality is genetic background-dependent.
Essential genes have certain characteristics that distinguish them from non-essential genes. For instance, essential genes often have a higher and more stable expression than the average non-essential gene1,2,4, tend to be more genetically conserved1,3 and are enriched in functional categories that support central cellular processes4,32. Of the different essential-gene categories, only universal essentials fulfill these three characteristics (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 8). Since gene essentiality for some genes depends on the strain background, we reasoned they would probably still trigger a growth defect in strains where they are not essential. Tn-seq was used to determine the fitness of these core strain-dependent essential genes in rich medium (Supplementary Data 9). Mutants with Tn insertions in core strain-dependent essentials, on average, have a significant fitness defect compared with mutants with insertions in non-essential genes (Fig. 1d). Moreover, Tn-seq in a mouse lung infection model33 shows that core strain-dependent essentials also have a significant defect in vivo compared with non-essentials. These data highlight that essential genes have characteristics that differentiate them from non-essential genes, and in some cases distinguish the universal, core strain-dependent and accessory groups from each other. Importantly, fitness defects caused by inactivation of strain-dependent essential genes show that genetic backgrounds responsible for essentiality bypass may not be able to entirely compensate for gene loss.
The existence of genes with variable essentiality underscores that genome composition can make essentiality evolvable. To determine whether different levels of essential-gene evolvability exist, five universal and six core strain-dependent essentials were targeted in four different backgrounds to obtain knockout mutants. Transformation with a PCR product containing a drug marker fused to ~2,000 bp of DNA flanking a non-essential gene of interest will normally, with increasing amounts of DNA, generate an increasing number of knockout transformants34. However, during the transformation process, additional lesions may occur elsewhere in the genome. We thereby reasoned that by using more DNA, we could increase the chance of recovering an essential gene-knockout due to simultaneously occurring mutations that bypass the loss of the essential gene (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Transformation efficiency was generally much lower when targeting universal essential genes compared with non-essential genes (Fig. 1e). However, a surprisingly large number of colonies grew for 18 out of the 20 gene/strain combinations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that these colonies were, in fact, merodiploids, that is, bacteria containing genomes in which a wild-type copy of the essential gene is retained35 (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Data 10). The large amounts of DNA used for transformation probably accounts for the high merodiploid frequency. Importantly, besides the merodiploids, no other ‘solutions’ were found for the five universal essentials, confirming that their essentiality cannot be easily overcome.
Transforming strains in which the six core strain-dependent essential genes are non-essential yielded many WGS-confirmed transformants (Fig. 1e). In contrast, transformation of strains in which these genes are essential showed three types of results: (1) For genes SP_0185 and SP_0376, a low number of colonies were recovered, all of which were merodiploids, indicating essentiality is not easily bypassed; (2) For gene SP_1603/cmk, a high number of colonies were recovered. WGS confirmed clean knockouts without additional genetic changes, indicating that SP_1603 is, in fact, a non-essential gene; (3) For genes SP_1205, SP_1229 and SP_1569, a low number of colonies were recovered, consisting of a mix of true knockouts and merodiploids, suggesting that core strain-dependent essential genes can indeed lose their essentiality through background changes, which are explored in more detail below.
SP_1603/cmk, involved in the recycling of cytidine monophosphate (CMP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP) (Fig. 2a), has been indicated as an essential gene in S. pneumoniae for almost two decades, even though small colonies have been observed after transformation36. Additionally, our Tn-seq data predict cmk to be essential in 12 out of 21 strains (Supplementary Data 6). However, we were able to obtain many WGS-confirmed transformants in three strain backgrounds where cmk was predicted as essential (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Data 10).
Growth curves of S. pneumoniae Δcmk highlight strain-dependent differences; two out of three backgrounds display an extended lag phase, while strain PG04 has the most severe defects (Fig. 2b), probably explaining why cmk seems essential in Tn-seq. In E. coli, Δcmk accumulates 30-fold more CMP and dCTP pools decrease by half37. However, nutritional supplementation in S. pneumoniae suggests that neither a dCTP shortage nor CMP accumulation reduced choline teichoic acid decoration, underlie the observed defects (Extended Data Fig. 4a).
CMP is also produced by PgsA (SP_2222), an enzyme required for phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro) synthesis (Fig. 2c). Mutations in pgsA decrease PtdGro and cardiolipin (CL) and confer daptomycin resistance in four distinct Gram-positive species38,39. CMP accumulation, mediated by Δcmk, may thus alter membrane lipid composition and daptomycin susceptibility. We examined membrane polar lipid composition by acetate-labelling and thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4b), identifying strain-specific differences. For instance, TIGR4 PtdGro levels are almost twice as high compared with other strains, which may explain why TIGR4 is so sensitive to daptomycin (Fig. 2e). Overall, Δcmk decreases CL and increases galactosyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Gal-Glu-DAG) levels, although changes in PG27 are modest. Previous Tn-seq on TIGR4 found that ΔSP_1075, the gene responsible for Gal-Glu-DAG synthesis (Fig. 2c), is highly sensitive to daptomycin20. We observed decreased daptomycin sensitivity for Δcmk (Fig. 2e), which may thus be (partially) explained by increased Gal-Glu-DAG levels. There is no direct metabolic link between CMP and glycolipid synthesis, making it unclear how Δcmk affects Gal-Glu-DAG levels. However, since uridine triphosphate (UTP) is the precursor to CTP, Δcmk probably results in decreased UTP pools, which would need to be ramped up and thereby impact glycolipid synthesis. Importantly, this shows how something as simple as CMP accumulation can affect lipid composition, and that while cmk is important for growth but not essential, its effects on the processes it is connected to can vary significantly depending on the genetic background.
Multiple examples exist of accessory essentials interacting with core genome genes, affecting essentiality. For instance, within the genetic addiction module SP_1809/1810, the essential antitoxin (SP_1809) requires the Clp protease subunit ClpX (SP_1569) to degrade the toxin (SP_1810)40. clpX is thereby only essential in strains harbouring the toxin/antitoxin (Supplementary Data 6), as their genetic loss allows for the recovery of a clpX knockout in a strain where clpX is essential (Supplementary Data 10). Another example includes capsule-related biosynthesis genes. S. pneumoniae’s capsule crucially interacts with the immune system41, which creates selective pressure that drives a high diversity in capsule serotypes. Capsule synthesis genes are organized in a large 20–30 kb operon42, mostly consisting of accessory essentials (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 6). However, the sugar transferase43 responsible for attaching the first capsule residue to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UP) is always non-essential. In D39, missense/nonsense mutations in the sugar transferase relieve essentiality of downstream capsule genes44. To determine whether this applies across the pan-genome, we knocked out the sugar transferase in four different strains and introduced transposon libraries in these query-gene backgrounds. Using Tn-seq, we find that within these sugar transferase knockout strains, the essentiality of the downstream capsule genes is indeed suppressed (Fig. 3b). This suppression of essentiality shows that blocking of the attachment of the initial UDP-sugar residue to UP prevents a lethal dead-end lipid carrier trapping42.
As previously described, acapsular strains have an earlier onset of autolysis (Fig. 3c)45. Autolysis depends on the choline-binding protein LytA (SP_1739)46, and accordingly, also relates to the amount of choline in the medium. Importantly, Tn-seq in the background of the sugar transferase knockout reveals multiple synthetic lethal interactions with teichoic acid synthesis (Fig. 3b,d, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 11). These results, and the observation that unencapsulated strains present more phosphorylcholine on the cell surface47, suggest that teichoic acid production increases in the context of the sugar transferase knockout, and this increase may explain the early onset of autolysis of S. pneumoniae unencapsulated strains.
Overall, these data show that essentiality of capsule biosynthesis can be bypassed by blocking its initiation. However, this interference with capsule synthesis comes at a cost, as indicated by the high number of synthetic lethal/negative interactions between the sugar transferases and other non-essential genes. Importantly, this highlights the potential of synergistic antimicrobials targeting accessory essentials and core genes.
S. pneumoniae’s core genome includes two CorA family48 magnesium transporters (Fig. 4a; SP_0185, SP_1751). SP_0185 is essential in 8 out of 21 strains (Supplementary Data 6) and SP_1751 is non-essential. Unsuccessful attempts to construct SP_0185 knockouts in essential backgrounds suggest that bypassing its essentiality is hard. Tn-seq genetic interaction screening in PG04, a strain where the transporter is non-essential, uncovers synthetic lethality with the non-essential transporter SP_1751 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 11), indicating that the essentiality of SP_0185 relies on potential functional redundancy with SP_1751.
To confirm that this redundancy lies in Mg2+ homoeostasis, we evaluated growth of nine wild-type strains and ΔSP_0185-PG04 at different Mg2+ concentrations and in the presence of hexammine cobalt, a drug that targets CorA proteins49 (Fig. 4c,d). Results show that: (1) ΔSP_0185-PG04 acquires magnesium through another transporter sensitive to hexammine cobalt, corroborating the identified synthetic lethality with SP_1751; and (2) the strains where SP_0185 is essential rely predominantly on one transporter to acquire Mg2+, relinquishing SP_1751’s redundancy in these strains.
To better understand the strain-dependent redundancy, we explored their genomic context, protein sequence and expression levels (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Table 1). First, two genomic arrangements exist for gene SP_0185 across the PG collection depending on the presence of an upstream prophage. Second, while SP_0185 is conserved, SP_1751 exhibits polymorphisms that only appear in strains where SP_0185 is essential. Third, strains with the prophage display some of the highest expression levels for both transporters and are the strains in which SP_0185 is non-essential. This suggests that a high expression of SP_1751 in combination with several specific polymorphisms can overcome SP_0185’s essentiality. However, while the magnesium transporters are at least partially redundant in a strain-dependent manner, on the species level, SP_0185 is the main transporter.
Undecaprenyl phosphate (UP) is a crucial bacterial molecule involved in translocating peptidoglycan, teichoic acids and capsule intermediates from the cytoplasm to the outer leaf of the membrane50. The core strain-dependent essential gene SP_1205 forms part of the UP-biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 5a). We confirmed SP_1205’s non-essentiality in PG06, while for strains PG16 and TIGR4, in which the gene is essential, very few transformants were obtained. Excitingly, WGS confirmed that these transformants lack a functional SP_1205 copy while revealing multiple putative suppressive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Data 10), suggesting that its essentiality may be bypassed.
Many of the putative bypass mutations and synthetic lethal interactions obtained from Tn-seq in ΔSP_1205-PG06 associate with two cellular processes: (1) the utilization of disaccharides leading to capsule biosynthesis; and (2) the recycling of UP (Fig. 5b). To validate the first process, growth was evaluated with the disaccharide sucrose and minodronate (MNDR), a drug targeting SP_1205 (Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7a). For wild-type strains, MNDR sensitivity increases in the presence of sucrose, highlighting SP_1205’s importance, with a disaccharide as the main carbon source. Tn-seq genetic interaction experiments show that the capsule sugar transferase has a robust negative interaction with SP_1205, demonstrating capsule production essentiality in the absence of SP_1205 (Supplementary Data 11). Additionally, growth in the presence of sucrose negatively affects S. pneumoniae capsule production51. Synthetic lethality between SP_1205 and genes involved in disaccharide utilization can therefore be explained by a consequential decrease in capsule production.
A second set of suppressive SNPs and genetic interactions relate to UP recycling (Fig. 5b, and Supplementary Data 10 and 11). UP homoeostasis depends on a critical balance between demand, synthesis and recycling, in which SP_1205 sits at the root. Bacitracin is a drug that prevents undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP) recycling to UP, and genes previously described as induced by and required to overcome bacitracin are synthetically lethal with SP_120552. We hypothesized, that ΔSP_1205 would be more sensitive to bacitracin, which we confirmed, indicating that when synthesis is inhibited, recycling of UPP becomes more crucial (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Interestingly, PG06-WT, in which SP_1205 is non-essential, is more sensitive to bacitracin than for instance TIGR4, in which SP_1205 is essential, suggesting that in PG06, UP homoeostasis is skewed towards recycling. Importantly, these data show that S. pneumoniae can evolve different solutions to make SP_1205 dispensable. However, besides these solutions, any induced stress that affects UP homoeostasis or capsule production makes SP_1205 essential.
The enzyme encoded by SP_1229 (Formate tetrahydrofolate ligase, Fhs) belongs to the one-carbon pool by folate pathway. In this pathway, tetrahydrofolate derivatives donate one carbon for the synthesis of purines and amino acids (Fig. 6a)53. Knockouts were recovered for two strains where SP_1229 is non-essential, and for PG16 (where it is essential) but only in combination with potential suppressor SNPs (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 10).
To investigate how SP_1229 essentiality can be bypassed, we evaluated growth in the presence of cotrimoxazole (SXT) (Fig. 6b), which inhibits synthesis of SP_1229’s substrate tetrahydrofolate. PG04 and the PG16-derived knockouts grow slower in rich medium, and except for one of the PG16-derived knockouts have increased sensitivity to SXT. In contrast, the TIGR4-derived knockout grows similarly to the wild type. These results show that besides the strain-dependent essentiality of SP_1229, the effects of deleting the gene differ across strains where the gene is non-essential.
Tn-seq experiments with PG04, TIGR4 and two different PG16-derived knockouts revealed shared and strain-dependent genetic interactions with SP_1229 (Supplementary Data 11). Interestingly, nine genes have an opposite genetic interaction in TIGR4 compared with the other three backgrounds (Fig. 6c). A key interaction exists with the serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene SP_1024. This enzyme is synthetically lethal with SP_1229 in PG04 and PG16 but not in TIGR4, and can bypass SP_1229 by using serine as substrate (Fig. 6a). Two lines of evidence suggest that this bypass mechanism links with (p)ppGpp metabolism. First, some strains such as PG16 require additional changes to bypass SP_1229, including suppressor SNPs in the (p)ppGpp synthetase enzyme RelA (SP_1645), and two related enzymes SP_0012 and SP_1738. Second, in D39, mupirocin—a drug that robustly triggers the stringent response—induces the expression of SP_1024 in an SP_1645-dependent manner54. Overall, these results show that different bypass mechanisms exist to overcome SP_1229 inactivation.
A pan-genome (PG) collection was assembled, consisting of 36 S. pneumoniae strains. To obtain a single contig for each strain, 33 were re-sequenced with PacBio (Bioproject PRJNA514780). This collection represents 16 capsule serotypes and 17 clusters of the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project (GPS)21 (Supplementary Data 1). Six are commonly used experimental strains including D39 and TIGR418,22, while 30 strains are part of a larger S. pneumoniae surveillance collection23. Notably, these 30 strains consist of 15 genetically similar pairs (Supplementary Data 2), which should display similar phenotypes.
To determine the degree to which the PG collection reflects the S. pneumoniae pan-genome, a ‘pan-genome study group’ was created, consisting of 208 strains covering 64 different GPS clusters (Supplementary Data 3)21,24, 25, 26–27. Three different pan-genome analysis tools28, 29–30 were used to estimate the size of the pan-genome at >4,100 genes (all genes in the species) and a core genome of 1,349 genes (present in all strains), which is similar to previous estimates16,17 (Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Data 4 and 5). In-depth analyses indicate that the 36-strain PG collection scatters evenly through a phylogenetic tree, and is representative of the S. pneumoniae pan-genome by covering >68% of its genetic content (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Fig. 1a).
Tn-seq was employed to determine gene essentiality across the PG collection. Tn library construction was successful in 21 out of 36 strains. Variable transformation efficiency across strains affects this success and depends on both known and unknown factors, including capsule serotype31. Tn-seq predicts gene essentiality on the basis of library saturation (percentage of transposon-occupied thymidine-adenosine sites) and the lack of insertions in a gene. Out of 21 libraries, 17 had >35% saturation, enabling high-confidence essentiality predictions ranging from 274 (PG29) to 379 (PG02) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 6). From the high-confidence ‘essential’ category, the ‘essentialome’ is defined as consisting of 520 genes that are essential in at least one strain. Using gene cluster comparisons of essentiality predictions across strains, the essentialome is further subdivided into: (1) 206 universal essentials: core genome genes that are present and essential in each strain; (2) 186 core strain-dependent essentials: core genome genes that are present in all strains but only essential in some; and (3) 128 accessory essentials: accessory genome genes essential in strains where they are present (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 7). This categorization suggests that for a substantial number of genes, essentiality is genetic background-dependent.
Essential genes have certain characteristics that distinguish them from non-essential genes. For instance, essential genes often have a higher and more stable expression than the average non-essential gene1,2,4, tend to be more genetically conserved1,3 and are enriched in functional categories that support central cellular processes4,32. Of the different essential-gene categories, only universal essentials fulfill these three characteristics (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 8). Since gene essentiality for some genes depends on the strain background, we reasoned they would probably still trigger a growth defect in strains where they are not essential. Tn-seq was used to determine the fitness of these core strain-dependent essential genes in rich medium (Supplementary Data 9). Mutants with Tn insertions in core strain-dependent essentials, on average, have a significant fitness defect compared with mutants with insertions in non-essential genes (Fig. 1d). Moreover, Tn-seq in a mouse lung infection model33 shows that core strain-dependent essentials also have a significant defect in vivo compared with non-essentials. These data highlight that essential genes have characteristics that differentiate them from non-essential genes, and in some cases distinguish the universal, core strain-dependent and accessory groups from each other. Importantly, fitness defects caused by inactivation of strain-dependent essential genes show that genetic backgrounds responsible for essentiality bypass may not be able to entirely compensate for gene loss.
The existence of genes with variable essentiality underscores that genome composition can make essentiality evolvable. To determine whether different levels of essential-gene evolvability exist, five universal and six core strain-dependent essentials were targeted in four different backgrounds to obtain knockout mutants. Transformation with a PCR product containing a drug marker fused to ~2,000 bp of DNA flanking a non-essential gene of interest will normally, with increasing amounts of DNA, generate an increasing number of knockout transformants34. However, during the transformation process, additional lesions may occur elsewhere in the genome. We thereby reasoned that by using more DNA, we could increase the chance of recovering an essential gene-knockout due to simultaneously occurring mutations that bypass the loss of the essential gene (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Transformation efficiency was generally much lower when targeting universal essential genes compared with non-essential genes (Fig. 1e). However, a surprisingly large number of colonies grew for 18 out of the 20 gene/strain combinations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that these colonies were, in fact, merodiploids, that is, bacteria containing genomes in which a wild-type copy of the essential gene is retained35 (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Data 10). The large amounts of DNA used for transformation probably accounts for the high merodiploid frequency. Importantly, besides the merodiploids, no other ‘solutions’ were found for the five universal essentials, confirming that their essentiality cannot be easily overcome.
Transforming strains in which the six core strain-dependent essential genes are non-essential yielded many WGS-confirmed transformants (Fig. 1e). In contrast, transformation of strains in which these genes are essential showed three types of results: (1) For genes SP_0185 and SP_0376, a low number of colonies were recovered, all of which were merodiploids, indicating essentiality is not easily bypassed; (2) For gene SP_1603/cmk, a high number of colonies were recovered. WGS confirmed clean knockouts without additional genetic changes, indicating that SP_1603 is, in fact, a non-essential gene; (3) For genes SP_1205, SP_1229 and SP_1569, a low number of colonies were recovered, consisting of a mix of true knockouts and merodiploids, suggesting that core strain-dependent essential genes can indeed lose their essentiality through background changes, which are explored in more detail below.
SP_1603/cmk, involved in the recycling of cytidine monophosphate (CMP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP) (Fig. 2a), has been indicated as an essential gene in S. pneumoniae for almost two decades, even though small colonies have been observed after transformation36. Additionally, our Tn-seq data predict cmk to be essential in 12 out of 21 strains (Supplementary Data 6). However, we were able to obtain many WGS-confirmed transformants in three strain backgrounds where cmk was predicted as essential (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Data 10).
Growth curves of S. pneumoniae Δcmk highlight strain-dependent differences; two out of three backgrounds display an extended lag phase, while strain PG04 has the most severe defects (Fig. 2b), probably explaining why cmk seems essential in Tn-seq. In E. coli, Δcmk accumulates 30-fold more CMP and dCTP pools decrease by half37. However, nutritional supplementation in S. pneumoniae suggests that neither a dCTP shortage nor CMP accumulation reduced choline teichoic acid decoration, underlie the observed defects (Extended Data Fig. 4a).
CMP is also produced by PgsA (SP_2222), an enzyme required for phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro) synthesis (Fig. 2c). Mutations in pgsA decrease PtdGro and cardiolipin (CL) and confer daptomycin resistance in four distinct Gram-positive species38,39. CMP accumulation, mediated by Δcmk, may thus alter membrane lipid composition and daptomycin susceptibility. We examined membrane polar lipid composition by acetate-labelling and thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4b), identifying strain-specific differences. For instance, TIGR4 PtdGro levels are almost twice as high compared with other strains, which may explain why TIGR4 is so sensitive to daptomycin (Fig. 2e). Overall, Δcmk decreases CL and increases galactosyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Gal-Glu-DAG) levels, although changes in PG27 are modest. Previous Tn-seq on TIGR4 found that ΔSP_1075, the gene responsible for Gal-Glu-DAG synthesis (Fig. 2c), is highly sensitive to daptomycin20. We observed decreased daptomycin sensitivity for Δcmk (Fig. 2e), which may thus be (partially) explained by increased Gal-Glu-DAG levels. There is no direct metabolic link between CMP and glycolipid synthesis, making it unclear how Δcmk affects Gal-Glu-DAG levels. However, since uridine triphosphate (UTP) is the precursor to CTP, Δcmk probably results in decreased UTP pools, which would need to be ramped up and thereby impact glycolipid synthesis. Importantly, this shows how something as simple as CMP accumulation can affect lipid composition, and that while cmk is important for growth but not essential, its effects on the processes it is connected to can vary significantly depending on the genetic background.
Multiple examples exist of accessory essentials interacting with core genome genes, affecting essentiality. For instance, within the genetic addiction module SP_1809/1810, the essential antitoxin (SP_1809) requires the Clp protease subunit ClpX (SP_1569) to degrade the toxin (SP_1810)40. clpX is thereby only essential in strains harbouring the toxin/antitoxin (Supplementary Data 6), as their genetic loss allows for the recovery of a clpX knockout in a strain where clpX is essential (Supplementary Data 10). Another example includes capsule-related biosynthesis genes. S. pneumoniae’s capsule crucially interacts with the immune system41, which creates selective pressure that drives a high diversity in capsule serotypes. Capsule synthesis genes are organized in a large 20–30 kb operon42, mostly consisting of accessory essentials (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 6). However, the sugar transferase43 responsible for attaching the first capsule residue to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UP) is always non-essential. In D39, missense/nonsense mutations in the sugar transferase relieve essentiality of downstream capsule genes44. To determine whether this applies across the pan-genome, we knocked out the sugar transferase in four different strains and introduced transposon libraries in these query-gene backgrounds. Using Tn-seq, we find that within these sugar transferase knockout strains, the essentiality of the downstream capsule genes is indeed suppressed (Fig. 3b). This suppression of essentiality shows that blocking of the attachment of the initial UDP-sugar residue to UP prevents a lethal dead-end lipid carrier trapping42.
As previously described, acapsular strains have an earlier onset of autolysis (Fig. 3c)45. Autolysis depends on the choline-binding protein LytA (SP_1739)46, and accordingly, also relates to the amount of choline in the medium. Importantly, Tn-seq in the background of the sugar transferase knockout reveals multiple synthetic lethal interactions with teichoic acid synthesis (Fig. 3b,d, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 11). These results, and the observation that unencapsulated strains present more phosphorylcholine on the cell surface47, suggest that teichoic acid production increases in the context of the sugar transferase knockout, and this increase may explain the early onset of autolysis of S. pneumoniae unencapsulated strains.
Overall, these data show that essentiality of capsule biosynthesis can be bypassed by blocking its initiation. However, this interference with capsule synthesis comes at a cost, as indicated by the high number of synthetic lethal/negative interactions between the sugar transferases and other non-essential genes. Importantly, this highlights the potential of synergistic antimicrobials targeting accessory essentials and core genes.
S. pneumoniae’s core genome includes two CorA family48 magnesium transporters (Fig. 4a; SP_0185, SP_1751). SP_0185 is essential in 8 out of 21 strains (Supplementary Data 6) and SP_1751 is non-essential. Unsuccessful attempts to construct SP_0185 knockouts in essential backgrounds suggest that bypassing its essentiality is hard. Tn-seq genetic interaction screening in PG04, a strain where the transporter is non-essential, uncovers synthetic lethality with the non-essential transporter SP_1751 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 11), indicating that the essentiality of SP_0185 relies on potential functional redundancy with SP_1751.
To confirm that this redundancy lies in Mg2+ homoeostasis, we evaluated growth of nine wild-type strains and ΔSP_0185-PG04 at different Mg2+ concentrations and in the presence of hexammine cobalt, a drug that targets CorA proteins49 (Fig. 4c,d). Results show that: (1) ΔSP_0185-PG04 acquires magnesium through another transporter sensitive to hexammine cobalt, corroborating the identified synthetic lethality with SP_1751; and (2) the strains where SP_0185 is essential rely predominantly on one transporter to acquire Mg2+, relinquishing SP_1751’s redundancy in these strains.
To better understand the strain-dependent redundancy, we explored their genomic context, protein sequence and expression levels (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Table 1). First, two genomic arrangements exist for gene SP_0185 across the PG collection depending on the presence of an upstream prophage. Second, while SP_0185 is conserved, SP_1751 exhibits polymorphisms that only appear in strains where SP_0185 is essential. Third, strains with the prophage display some of the highest expression levels for both transporters and are the strains in which SP_0185 is non-essential. This suggests that a high expression of SP_1751 in combination with several specific polymorphisms can overcome SP_0185’s essentiality. However, while the magnesium transporters are at least partially redundant in a strain-dependent manner, on the species level, SP_0185 is the main transporter.
Undecaprenyl phosphate (UP) is a crucial bacterial molecule involved in translocating peptidoglycan, teichoic acids and capsule intermediates from the cytoplasm to the outer leaf of the membrane50. The core strain-dependent essential gene SP_1205 forms part of the UP-biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 5a). We confirmed SP_1205’s non-essentiality in PG06, while for strains PG16 and TIGR4, in which the gene is essential, very few transformants were obtained. Excitingly, WGS confirmed that these transformants lack a functional SP_1205 copy while revealing multiple putative suppressive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Data 10), suggesting that its essentiality may be bypassed.
Many of the putative bypass mutations and synthetic lethal interactions obtained from Tn-seq in ΔSP_1205-PG06 associate with two cellular processes: (1) the utilization of disaccharides leading to capsule biosynthesis; and (2) the recycling of UP (Fig. 5b). To validate the first process, growth was evaluated with the disaccharide sucrose and minodronate (MNDR), a drug targeting SP_1205 (Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7a). For wild-type strains, MNDR sensitivity increases in the presence of sucrose, highlighting SP_1205’s importance, with a disaccharide as the main carbon source. Tn-seq genetic interaction experiments show that the capsule sugar transferase has a robust negative interaction with SP_1205, demonstrating capsule production essentiality in the absence of SP_1205 (Supplementary Data 11). Additionally, growth in the presence of sucrose negatively affects S. pneumoniae capsule production51. Synthetic lethality between SP_1205 and genes involved in disaccharide utilization can therefore be explained by a consequential decrease in capsule production.
A second set of suppressive SNPs and genetic interactions relate to UP recycling (Fig. 5b, and Supplementary Data 10 and 11). UP homoeostasis depends on a critical balance between demand, synthesis and recycling, in which SP_1205 sits at the root. Bacitracin is a drug that prevents undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP) recycling to UP, and genes previously described as induced by and required to overcome bacitracin are synthetically lethal with SP_120552. We hypothesized, that ΔSP_1205 would be more sensitive to bacitracin, which we confirmed, indicating that when synthesis is inhibited, recycling of UPP becomes more crucial (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Interestingly, PG06-WT, in which SP_1205 is non-essential, is more sensitive to bacitracin than for instance TIGR4, in which SP_1205 is essential, suggesting that in PG06, UP homoeostasis is skewed towards recycling. Importantly, these data show that S. pneumoniae can evolve different solutions to make SP_1205 dispensable. However, besides these solutions, any induced stress that affects UP homoeostasis or capsule production makes SP_1205 essential.
The enzyme encoded by SP_1229 (Formate tetrahydrofolate ligase, Fhs) belongs to the one-carbon pool by folate pathway. In this pathway, tetrahydrofolate derivatives donate one carbon for the synthesis of purines and amino acids (Fig. 6a)53. Knockouts were recovered for two strains where SP_1229 is non-essential, and for PG16 (where it is essential) but only in combination with potential suppressor SNPs (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 10).
To investigate how SP_1229 essentiality can be bypassed, we evaluated growth in the presence of cotrimoxazole (SXT) (Fig. 6b), which inhibits synthesis of SP_1229’s substrate tetrahydrofolate. PG04 and the PG16-derived knockouts grow slower in rich medium, and except for one of the PG16-derived knockouts have increased sensitivity to SXT. In contrast, the TIGR4-derived knockout grows similarly to the wild type. These results show that besides the strain-dependent essentiality of SP_1229, the effects of deleting the gene differ across strains where the gene is non-essential.
Tn-seq experiments with PG04, TIGR4 and two different PG16-derived knockouts revealed shared and strain-dependent genetic interactions with SP_1229 (Supplementary Data 11). Interestingly, nine genes have an opposite genetic interaction in TIGR4 compared with the other three backgrounds (Fig. 6c). A key interaction exists with the serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene SP_1024. This enzyme is synthetically lethal with SP_1229 in PG04 and PG16 but not in TIGR4, and can bypass SP_1229 by using serine as substrate (Fig. 6a). Two lines of evidence suggest that this bypass mechanism links with (p)ppGpp metabolism. First, some strains such as PG16 require additional changes to bypass SP_1229, including suppressor SNPs in the (p)ppGpp synthetase enzyme RelA (SP_1645), and two related enzymes SP_0012 and SP_1738. Second, in D39, mupirocin—a drug that robustly triggers the stringent response—induces the expression of SP_1024 in an SP_1645-dependent manner54. Overall, these results show that different bypass mechanisms exist to overcome SP_1229 inactivation.
We used a systems biology approach to determine, at the species level, how a bacterial pan-genome might influence gene essentiality, and whether essential genes can evolve to become non-essential. We identified a set of 206 universally essential genes whose essentiality cannot be circumvented and 186 strain-dependent essential genes for whom the genetic background is a significant modulator of essentiality. An advantage of this strain-dependent essentiality is that it enables an approach to infer gene function, for instance, through analysis of compensatory mechanisms. Our main findings extend beyond S. pneumoniae biology, with at least two important consequences. First, rather than classifying genes as essential, it may be more useful to approach essentiality in a more quantitative manner6 that includes context-dependency and evolvability. Second, our findings that many essential genes are influenced by their genetic background may undermine their attractiveness as candidate drug targets. However, we show that elimination of core strain-specific essentials come with a large fitness cost, especially in vivo, indicating that drug inhibitors would still be efficacious. Moreover, our genetic interaction and drug-sensitivity assays highlight that strain-dependent essentials could work in synergistic approaches. Lastly, a pan-genome with strain-dependent essentiality, and more specifically, strains in which essentiality can be altered by changes to the genetic background, may also create new targeted drug screening opportunities. Different sets of strains with changes to different pathways and/or processes which thereby enable differential essentiality can be used to identify compounds that target a specific gene product and/or process. We are currently exploring these and other approaches, which highlights how exploration of basic biology can potentially go hand in hand with the development of new antimicrobial strategies.
S. pneumoniae strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Thirty of them (PG01 to PG30) belong to a surveillance study done in a Nijmegen hospital, the Netherlands23, while the other six are lab strains available at our lab.
Different strains were grown on tryptic soy agar or blood agar base no. 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) plates supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep’s blood at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Liquid cultures were grown statically in THY, C+Y or semi-defined minimal media (SDMM) at pH 7.3, with 5 µl ml−1 oxyrase (Oxyrase)2 at the same incubation conditions as plates. For growth curve assays, strains were grown in THY until an optical density (OD)600 of ~0.5, pelleted and resuspended in the same volume of phosphate saline buffer (PBS). OD600 was adjusted to 0.05 in PBS and 20 μl of this suspension were diluted in 180 μl of different media conditions in wells of flat-bottom 96-well plates. OD600 measurements were taken on a BioSpa 8 plate reader (BioTek) and experiments were repeated at least three times. Different modifications to SDMM were assayed as described in figure legends and text.
To obtain high-quality and high-yield genomic DNA for PacBio sequencing and Tn-seq libraries construction, strains were grown in 20 ml THY (plus oxyrase, plus catalase 200 units per ml) until an OD600 of ~0.7, and cells were recovered by centrifugation (3,000 g, 7 min). Pellets were subsequently processed and genomic DNA purified using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 100/G columns. Initial lysis of cells was achieved by resuspending pellets in a lysis buffer adapted for S. pneumoniae (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.0; 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0; 0.1% Tween-20; 1.1% Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate 1.5%) containing 200 μg ml−1 RNAse A (Macherey-Nagel) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The rest of the protocol was performed as described in the QIAGEN gDNA handbook. For mucoid strains, such as PG23 and PG24 (serotype 3), cells were washed once with 1 M NaCl and once with PBS before proceeding with lysis.
SMRT-seq was carried out on a PacBio Sequel-I instrument (Pacific Biosciences). Genomic DNA concentration was determined using the QuBit dSDNA HS (High Sensitivity) assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and purity was calculated using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer 1000. Genomic DNA samples (3 μg) were sheared to an average size of 10 kb via G-tube (Covaris) before library preparation. Libraries were then generated with SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 1.0 and pooled libraries were size selected using the BluePippin system with 0.75% Pippin Gel Cassettes and Marker S1 (Sage Sciences) at a 4 kb minimum threshold. Sequencing reads were processed using the Pacific Biosciences’ SMRTAnalysis pipeline version 8.0.0.80529 and assembled using Microbial Assembler.
Closed single contigs were annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline and genome assemblies and assembly information are made available as part of GenBank Bioproject PRJNA514780.
A pan-genome study group consisting of 208 isolates was constructed as follows: to the 30 strains selected from the Nijmegen surveillance, six diverse clinical and experimental lab strains were added: TIGR4 (first S. pneumoniae sequenced strain isolated from Norway), Taiwan19F (a penicillin-resistant strain isolated from Taiwan), BHN97 (isolated from Norway), two recent US isolates (CT22F and GA22F), and a derived clone of the Griffith-Avery model strain D39. Another 111 strains were added to include diversity obtained from various large-scale survey/sequencing projects that were performed across the world: 30 strains from a set of isolates collected from children during routine visits to primary care physicians in Massachusetts, United States25, 30 from a refugee camp in Maela, Thailand24, 30 from Southampton (United Kingdom) (‘WGS of carried S. pneumoniae during the implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the UK’, Bioproject PRJEB2417) and 21 from the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme (MLW) strain archive26. Furthermore, 23 S. pneumoniae closed genomes available in RefSeq55 and 38 strains isolated before 197427 completed the 208 strains set. Similar numbers of strains were chosen from each project to obtain a well-balanced dataset that is not dominated by a single study.
Three pipelines for orthologous gene clustering and pan-genome analysis (PanX28, PPanGGOLin29 and BF-Clust30) were applied to a study group of 208 sequenced isolates including the 36 strains of our collection (Supplementary Table 3 and 4). In the case of BF-Clust methodology, clusters were subclustered according to their genomic neighbourhood to discriminate between paralogues (Supplementary Table 5). When referring to specific genes, we used as a convention the old locus tag from TIGR4 (SP_#). For those genes not present in the TIGR4 genome, we used the D39 locus tag (SPD_#), Taiwan19F (SPT_#), or the BF-Clust subcluster ID (#_#).
Average nucleotide identity values between PG-collection strains were determined using KBase platform56. The phylogenetic tree of Extended Data Fig. 1a was obtained as an output from the PanX pipeline, constructed on the basis of the core genes SNPs of the selected 208 strains and edited using iTol57.
Six independent transposon libraries, each containing 10,000 to 20,000 insertion mutants, were constructed with transposon Magellan6 in the different strains as described previously34,58, with the following modifications: (1) gDNA used was isolated as described for PacBio sequencing, (2) Marc9 transposase expression was induced with 0.5 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in 2YT medium with 2% ethanol at 25 °C during 4 h and (3) transformation reactions were scaled up to 4 ml volume. Transposon mutants were recovered in blood agar base no. 2 plates supplemented with 5% sheep’s blood with 200 μg ml−1 spectinomycin. Libraries stock cultures were grown several independent times in THY medium, gDNA was isolated using Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel), and Tn-seq sample preparation and Illumina sequencing were done as previously described34,58.
The binomial method of the TRANSIT package was used for determination of essential genes in the 22 strains with constructed libraries59. Binomial categorization relies on the calculation of a z-value determined by library saturation, the number of teichoic acid (TA) sites in the gene, and a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to set the ‘non-essential’ and ‘essential’ z-value thresholds. ‘Uncertain’ predicted genes have z-values between these thresholds. Ten percent of the sequence of a gene from the 5’ and 3’ ends was omitted for the calculation of the z-value. To compare between strains and determine the essential genes classes, only strains with a saturation higher than 35% were considered (17 strains). The maximum and minimum z-values observed for each gene across strains were calculated. All genes with a maximum z-value above the essential threshold were included as part of the essentialome. Core genes with a minimum z-value above the essential threshold were classified as universal essentials. Core genes with maximum z-values above the essential threshold (thus part of the essentialome) but minimum z-values below the essential threshold were classified as core strain-dependent essential genes. One caveat to consider about this last classification is that for some genes, minimum z-values are in the uncertain zone (between essential and non-essential thresholds). This could lead to some false positives, especially for those genes with minimum z-values close to the essential threshold.
To obtain the average mutant fitness (W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym}

Cells were grown for 4 generations (~3 h). Genomic DNA from THY and SDMM-grown cells were processed for Tn-seq. Wi (where i denotes a specific insertion mutant) for each transposon insertion was calculated as previously described by comparing the fold expansion of the mutant relative to the rest of the population at the initial time (THY) and the final time (SDMM)33,58,60. All the mutants Wi in a specific gene, excluding those with insertions in the first and last 10% of the gene total sequence, were then used to calculate the W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

To statistically determine whether a gene interruption affected growth in SDMM, the following analysis for each strain was performed: (1) essential genes specific for each strain and genes with less than three data points were excluded from the analysis, (2) median average fitness across all genes was calculated (on the basis of results from Tn-seq experiments with high bottleneck, we assumed that the median is the better estimate for a fitness value that represents no effect on growth), (3) the observed W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Genetic interactions were determined by comparing Tn-seq binomial predictions (suppressive and synthetic lethality interactions) or SDMM fitness calculations (negative and positive interactions) between libraries constructed in wild-type backgrounds and specific knockout backgrounds (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Genes that changed their categorization from ‘essential’ in the wild-type (WT) context to ‘non-essential’ in the knockout context represent suppressive interactions, while genes that changed the opposite way represent synthetic lethality. To reduce false negatives, genes that changed their categorization from ‘uncertain’ in WT to ‘essential’ in knockout backgrounds were also tagged as synthetic lethality. These last synthetic lethality interactions thus have a lower confidence, especially for those ‘uncertain’ genes with binomial z-values closer to the ‘essential’ threshold. Positive and negative interactions were determined as follows: (1) SDMM growth rate ratio between site-directed constructed knockouts and WT was used as multiplicative model correction factor, (2) each mutant W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cells were grown in triplicate in THY medium until an OD600 of ~0.3. Then, RNA isolation, sample preparation and Illumina sequencing were performed as previously described63. Raw data analysis was also performed as described in ref. 63, with the exception that aggregated feature counts were transcripts per million normalized to compare across the different genes64.
Site-directed gene knockouts were constructed by replacing target gene sequences with a chloramphenicol and/or spectinomycin resistance cassette as described previously34, but using up to 1,000 ng of the allele exchange PCR product. All PCR reactions were done using Q5 polymerase (NEB). Primers used and knockouts constructed are described in Supplementary Data 12 and 13. Randomly selected colonies and in some cases, whole transformation populations, were recovered and their gDNA isolated using Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Deletions were confirmed by two PCR reactions using primers outside of the PCR product and primers specific to the antibiotic marker used (F0-MR, R0-MF, Extended Data Fig. 3a). Products of around 2 kb were expected for the two PCR reactions. The amplification of a product of around 4 kb in one of the reactions indicates that the clone or population consisted of merodiploids.
Complementation of SP_1603 knockouts was achieved by cloning a WT copy of SP_1603 gene under the control of the constitutive promoter P3 at the non-coding region downstream of SP_1885 (CEP locus)65.
For identification of putative suppressive mutations, strain gDNA concentrations were measured on a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and diluted to 10 ng ul−1 in 5 mM Tris HCl for library preparation using a Nextera kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 and reads were mapped to their corresponding reference genomes. Single nucleotide mutations, deletions and new arrangements were identified using the breseq pipeline66. Merodiploids were distinguished from knockouts by PCR as described above or by breseq. To distinguish merodiploids from knockouts, sequencing coverage of the target gene and the homology arms in the 3 kb product (Extended Data Fig. 3b) were examined. In a merodiploid, coverage of left and right arms is about double of the average coverage due to duplication, while the coverage of the target gene remains the same as the average. Another characteristic of merodiploids identifiable by breseq is that the left and right homology arms are jointed with a frequency of around 50%.
Some suppressive mutations were validated by co-transforming WT strains with a spectinomycin cassette that inserts in the neutral region between genes SP_2105-SP_2106 and a PCR product with the SNPs to validate in a 1:10 ratio. It is expected that about 20% of spectinomycin-resistant colonies obtained should contain the SNP67. The whole population was pooled and transformed with the target essential suppressed gene.
Strains were grown in C+Y medium at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.2, and 50 μCi of (1-14C)acetate was added. After a 2 h labelling period, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. The lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method68, and total incorporation was quantified by scintillation counting using Tri-Carb 2910 TR (Perkin Elmer). The lipids were separated by loading equivalent amounts of radioactivity on silica gel 60A thin-layer plates (Partisil LK6D; Whatman) and developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (80:10:14:3, v/v/v/v). After drying, the thin-layer plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen overnight. The signal intensity was read using a Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) phosphorimager and the distribution of label quantified using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The results are from two independent experiments.
Figure panels were created with Biorender.com (Boston College full license) and GraphPad Prism 9. CorA protein structures were modelled with SWISS-MODEL69 and edited using Chimera.X.1.2.5. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 9 and R 1.4.1106.

A pan-genome study group consisting of 208 isolates was constructed as follows: to the 30 strains selected from the Nijmegen surveillance, six diverse clinical and experimental lab strains were added: TIGR4 (first S. pneumoniae sequenced strain isolated from Norway), Taiwan19F (a penicillin-resistant strain isolated from Taiwan), BHN97 (isolated from Norway), two recent US isolates (CT22F and GA22F), and a derived clone of the Griffith-Avery model strain D39. Another 111 strains were added to include diversity obtained from various large-scale survey/sequencing projects that were performed across the world: 30 strains from a set of isolates collected from children during routine visits to primary care physicians in Massachusetts, United States25, 30 from a refugee camp in Maela, Thailand24, 30 from Southampton (United Kingdom) (‘WGS of carried S. pneumoniae during the implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the UK’, Bioproject PRJEB2417) and 21 from the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme (MLW) strain archive26. Furthermore, 23 S. pneumoniae closed genomes available in RefSeq55 and 38 strains isolated before 197427 completed the 208 strains set. Similar numbers of strains were chosen from each project to obtain a well-balanced dataset that is not dominated by a single study.
Three pipelines for orthologous gene clustering and pan-genome analysis (PanX28, PPanGGOLin29 and BF-Clust30) were applied to a study group of 208 sequenced isolates including the 36 strains of our collection (Supplementary Table 3 and 4). In the case of BF-Clust methodology, clusters were subclustered according to their genomic neighbourhood to discriminate between paralogues (Supplementary Table 5). When referring to specific genes, we used as a convention the old locus tag from TIGR4 (SP_#). For those genes not present in the TIGR4 genome, we used the D39 locus tag (SPD_#), Taiwan19F (SPT_#), or the BF-Clust subcluster ID (#_#).
Average nucleotide identity values between PG-collection strains were determined using KBase platform56. The phylogenetic tree of Extended Data Fig. 1a was obtained as an output from the PanX pipeline, constructed on the basis of the core genes SNPs of the selected 208 strains and edited using iTol57.
Six independent transposon libraries, each containing 10,000 to 20,000 insertion mutants, were constructed with transposon Magellan6 in the different strains as described previously34,58, with the following modifications: (1) gDNA used was isolated as described for PacBio sequencing, (2) Marc9 transposase expression was induced with 0.5 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in 2YT medium with 2% ethanol at 25 °C during 4 h and (3) transformation reactions were scaled up to 4 ml volume. Transposon mutants were recovered in blood agar base no. 2 plates supplemented with 5% sheep’s blood with 200 μg ml−1 spectinomycin. Libraries stock cultures were grown several independent times in THY medium, gDNA was isolated using Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel), and Tn-seq sample preparation and Illumina sequencing were done as previously described34,58.
The binomial method of the TRANSIT package was used for determination of essential genes in the 22 strains with constructed libraries59. Binomial categorization relies on the calculation of a z-value determined by library saturation, the number of teichoic acid (TA) sites in the gene, and a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to set the ‘non-essential’ and ‘essential’ z-value thresholds. ‘Uncertain’ predicted genes have z-values between these thresholds. Ten percent of the sequence of a gene from the 5’ and 3’ ends was omitted for the calculation of the z-value. To compare between strains and determine the essential genes classes, only strains with a saturation higher than 35% were considered (17 strains). The maximum and minimum z-values observed for each gene across strains were calculated. All genes with a maximum z-value above the essential threshold were included as part of the essentialome. Core genes with a minimum z-value above the essential threshold were classified as universal essentials. Core genes with maximum z-values above the essential threshold (thus part of the essentialome) but minimum z-values below the essential threshold were classified as core strain-dependent essential genes. One caveat to consider about this last classification is that for some genes, minimum z-values are in the uncertain zone (between essential and non-essential thresholds). This could lead to some false positives, especially for those genes with minimum z-values close to the essential threshold.

Cells were grown for 4 generations (~3 h). Genomic DNA from THY and SDMM-grown cells were processed for Tn-seq. Wi (where i denotes a specific insertion mutant) for each transposon insertion was calculated as previously described by comparing the fold expansion of the mutant relative to the rest of the population at the initial time (THY) and the final time (SDMM)33,58,60. All the mutants Wi in a specific gene, excluding those with insertions in the first and last 10% of the gene total sequence, were then used to calculate the W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

To statistically determine whether a gene interruption affected growth in SDMM, the following analysis for each strain was performed: (1) essential genes specific for each strain and genes with less than three data points were excluded from the analysis, (2) median average fitness across all genes was calculated (on the basis of results from Tn-seq experiments with high bottleneck, we assumed that the median is the better estimate for a fitness value that represents no effect on growth), (3) the observed W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Genetic interactions were determined by comparing Tn-seq binomial predictions (suppressive and synthetic lethality interactions) or SDMM fitness calculations (negative and positive interactions) between libraries constructed in wild-type backgrounds and specific knockout backgrounds (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Genes that changed their categorization from ‘essential’ in the wild-type (WT) context to ‘non-essential’ in the knockout context represent suppressive interactions, while genes that changed the opposite way represent synthetic lethality. To reduce false negatives, genes that changed their categorization from ‘uncertain’ in WT to ‘essential’ in knockout backgrounds were also tagged as synthetic lethality. These last synthetic lethality interactions thus have a lower confidence, especially for those ‘uncertain’ genes with binomial z-values closer to the ‘essential’ threshold. Positive and negative interactions were determined as follows: (1) SDMM growth rate ratio between site-directed constructed knockouts and WT was used as multiplicative model correction factor, (2) each mutant W¯\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cells were grown in triplicate in THY medium until an OD600 of ~0.3. Then, RNA isolation, sample preparation and Illumina sequencing were performed as previously described63. Raw data analysis was also performed as described in ref. 63, with the exception that aggregated feature counts were transcripts per million normalized to compare across the different genes64.
Site-directed gene knockouts were constructed by replacing target gene sequences with a chloramphenicol and/or spectinomycin resistance cassette as described previously34, but using up to 1,000 ng of the allele exchange PCR product. All PCR reactions were done using Q5 polymerase (NEB). Primers used and knockouts constructed are described in Supplementary Data 12 and 13. Randomly selected colonies and in some cases, whole transformation populations, were recovered and their gDNA isolated using Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Deletions were confirmed by two PCR reactions using primers outside of the PCR product and primers specific to the antibiotic marker used (F0-MR, R0-MF, Extended Data Fig. 3a). Products of around 2 kb were expected for the two PCR reactions. The amplification of a product of around 4 kb in one of the reactions indicates that the clone or population consisted of merodiploids.
Complementation of SP_1603 knockouts was achieved by cloning a WT copy of SP_1603 gene under the control of the constitutive promoter P3 at the non-coding region downstream of SP_1885 (CEP locus)65.
For identification of putative suppressive mutations, strain gDNA concentrations were measured on a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and diluted to 10 ng ul−1 in 5 mM Tris HCl for library preparation using a Nextera kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 and reads were mapped to their corresponding reference genomes. Single nucleotide mutations, deletions and new arrangements were identified using the breseq pipeline66. Merodiploids were distinguished from knockouts by PCR as described above or by breseq. To distinguish merodiploids from knockouts, sequencing coverage of the target gene and the homology arms in the 3 kb product (Extended Data Fig. 3b) were examined. In a merodiploid, coverage of left and right arms is about double of the average coverage due to duplication, while the coverage of the target gene remains the same as the average. Another characteristic of merodiploids identifiable by breseq is that the left and right homology arms are jointed with a frequency of around 50%.
Some suppressive mutations were validated by co-transforming WT strains with a spectinomycin cassette that inserts in the neutral region between genes SP_2105-SP_2106 and a PCR product with the SNPs to validate in a 1:10 ratio. It is expected that about 20% of spectinomycin-resistant colonies obtained should contain the SNP67. The whole population was pooled and transformed with the target essential suppressed gene.
Strains were grown in C+Y medium at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.2, and 50 μCi of (1-14C)acetate was added. After a 2 h labelling period, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. The lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method68, and total incorporation was quantified by scintillation counting using Tri-Carb 2910 TR (Perkin Elmer). The lipids were separated by loading equivalent amounts of radioactivity on silica gel 60A thin-layer plates (Partisil LK6D; Whatman) and developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (80:10:14:3, v/v/v/v). After drying, the thin-layer plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen overnight. The signal intensity was read using a Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) phosphorimager and the distribution of label quantified using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The results are from two independent experiments.
