Title: Comparative genomic analysis of Lactobacillus mucosae LM1 identifies potential niche-specific genes and pathways for gastrointestinal adaptation
Abstract: Lactobacillus mucosae is currently of interest as putative probiotics due to their metabolic capabilities and ability to colonize host mucosal niches.
L. mucosae LM1 has been studied in its functions in cell adhesion and pathogen inhibition, etc. It demonstrated unique abilities to use energy from carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate sources. Due to these functions, we report the first complete genome sequence of an
L. mucosae strain, L . mucosae LM1. Analysis of the pan-genome in comparison with closely-related Lactobacillus
species identified a complete glycogen metabolism pathway, as well as folate biosynthesis, complementing previous proteomic data on the LM1 strain. It also revealed common and unique niche-adaptation genes among the various
L. mucosae strains. The aim of this study was to derive genomic information that would reveal the probable mechanisms underlying the probiotic effect of
L. mucosae LM1, and provide a better understanding of the nature of L. mucosae sp. Introduction Lactobacillus spp. are members of the family Lactobacillaceae and are generally low-GC-content, non-motile, non-spore-forming, anaerobic bacteria. The members of this genus are subgrouped by their carbohydrate fermentation profiles, namely, obligately homofermentative, facultatively heterofermentative, and obligately heterofermentative. The genus Lactobacillus is a member of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) group that plays a key role in the gastrointestinal tract [1] . It belongs to Firmicutes , which is a major mucosa-associated phylum of the gut microbiota, especially in the pars nonglandularis [2] . The genus Lactobacillus reportedly exerts beneficial effects on human and animal health [1,3,4] .
Lactobacillus mucosae was first identified by Roos et al. [5] using the mucus-binding (MUB) gene from Lactobacillus reuteri as a probe. Initial research on L. mucosae revealed its ability to adhere to pig mucus [5] . In humans, L. mucosae represents one of the strongly mucosa-associated subpopulations of the intestinal microbiota, together with Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium breve [6] . Its tight association with the mucosal layer and its presence in other mucosal niches, such as the human cervix and vagina, demonstrate the affinity of L. mucosae for mucin components and the host mucosal layer [7] .
L . mucosae LM1 has various probiotic traits; for example, acid and bile tolerance, which facilitates survival during transit through the gastrointestinal tract [8,9] , production of antibacterial substances against various Gram-positive and -negative pathogens [8] , adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells [10] , and inhibition of enteropathogens in vitro [8,10] . Its ability to aggregate, adhere to mucus, and inhibit adhesion of pathogens are prerequisites for competitiveness in, and transient colonization of, the host gut [10] .
A draft genome sequence of LM1 [11] revealed the presence of numerous adhesion genes. To characterize its probiotic properties, the complete genome of LM1 was sequenced, which is a first for an L. mucosae strain, and compared with those of other draft genomes of L. mucosae strains, and of the completed genomes of the closely associated species L. reuteri and Lactobacillus fermentum . The data will enable assessment of the biotechnological and probiotic potential of this L. mucosae strain and, likewise, provide a foundation for understanding L. mucosae species for further applications.
Results and discussion Genome features After resequencing, reannotation, and reassembly, the L. mucosae LM1 complete genome was 2.43 Mbp, with a 2.33 Mbp circular chromosome (46.13% GC ratio) ( NZ_CP011013.1 ) and a 0.1 Mbp extrachromosomal plasmid, pLM1 ( NZ_CP011014.1 ). A total of 2161 open reading frame (ORF) genes were predicted from the circular chromosome, with 1998 protein-coding genes, 24 rRNA genes, 90 tRNA genes, and 49 pseudogenes. From the plasmid pLM1, 114 ORFs were identified, comprising 111 protein-coding genes, 1 tRNA gene, and 2 pseudogenes ( Table S1 ). A total of 1623 proteins (70.93%) were assigned functions based on the functional COG categories of the whole genome. A previous study of the draft genome sequence of LM1 failed to identify the plasmid incorporated in the LM1 genome. Annotation of plasmid pLM1 showed that COG functions involving replication, recombination, and DNA repair were the most abundant, and phage replication components (DNA polymerase III and DNA helicase) were also identified. Further study is required to understand the functional mechanisms of this plasmid.

The COG functions of the genes are presented in Table S2 . Genes involved in replication, recombination, and repair (8.49%) were most abundant, followed by amino acid transport and metabolism (7.73%), translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (6.35%), transcription (5.60%), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (5.55%), and cell wall/membrane biogenesis (5.03%). The functional enrichment of such ORFs in the genome suggests that L. mucosae LM1 is able to adapt to harsh environments, such as the human gastrointestinal tract [12–15] .

The functional enrichment of such ORFs in the genome suggests that L. mucosae LM1 is able to adapt to harsh environments, such as the human gastrointestinal tract [12–15] .
Therefore, we further analyzed three factors that may contribute to probiotic activity: (1) genes involved in stress resistance and maintenance of cell-envelope integrity, (2) genes that mediate signaling and regulatory mechanisms, and (3) adherence and cell-surface factors that mediate colonization and bacterium–host crosstalk [16] . A list of potential probiotic genes present in strain LM1 presented previously [8,11] and updated in this study are also included as supplementary Table S3. Such traits are important for the ability of probiotic microorganisms to compete with harmful bacteria, modulate the host immune system, and regulate the gut microbiota [4] .
L. mucosae LM1 plasmid (pLM1) The plasmid replicon pLM1 ( Fig. 1 C ) has a predicted incomplete 18.8 kb prophage region (at positions 20,613–39,427), which contains phage replication elements such as a recombinase and a phage tail fiber protein (Fig. S2). It is found within the oriC region ( rnpA-rmpH-dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB-rnpA gene cluster) [17] , adjacent to dnaA (LBLM1_RS00005). The conserved dnaA box clusters, dnaN (LBLM1_RS10815) and recF-gyrB (LBLM1_RS10805-LBLM1_RS10800), flank the predicted pLM1 sequence, which suggests incorporation of pLM1 within the putative chromosomal oriC site. This plasmid also contains prophage elements, suggesting that it is a phage-plasmid. Plasmids that also function as phages have been reported in other bacteria including Streptomyces [18] , E. coli [19,20] . However, whether this is the case in strain LM1 will require further investigation.
Whole sequence BLAST analysis of this plasmid region showed no significant similarity with other plasmids; however, specific sections aligned at an e-value of 4e-92 to chromosomal regions of L. amylolyticus L6 complete genome (76% identity), at 2e − 15 to chromosomal regions in the complete genomes of L. fermentum strains and L. oris J-1 (92–94%), and, likewise, at e-values of 3e − 14 to Leuconostoc mesenteroides plasmids (78–79%). These regions are annotated as either hypothetical proteins or phage integrases. Annotated ORFs also include mostly genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, such as deoxynucleoside kinases which were deemed important deoxynucleoside salvage pathways for DNA precursor biosynthesis in lactobacilli [21] .
Genomic islands The identified genomic islands (GIs) and their genes are summarized in Table S4 , with 68 predicted IS elements (File S1). The highest similarity of IS elements was with IS30 (12 hits), which is present in various Lactobacillus spp., including Lactobacillus plantarum [22] . Furthermore, the presence of an IS30-related element in L. plantarum is associated with genome plasticity and environmental adaptation, due to acquisition of putative genes such as those involved in sugar utilization [23] , which likely assists gut colonization.

A total of 12 GIs, which are of probable horizontal transfer origin, were identified in the LM1 genome ( Fig. 1 B). Using PHAST, three prophage elements were identified in the chromosome of LM1 ( Fig. 1 B and Fig. S1), where GI region 3 (GI-3) incorporates prophage 1 (P1). GI-4 coincides with prophage 2 (P2), and GI-9 and -10 with prophage 3 (P3).
The only intact prophage region (region 2) resembled Bacill_BalMu_1 (NC_030945), which is 32.02 kilobases (kb) in size. Non-phage elements in this region included ORFs involved in putative functions such as copper and potassium homeostasis, lipoprotein biosynthesis, and a phosphate transcriptional regulon may play a role in osmotic adaptation and stress signaling [24,25] . Interestingly, among the L. mucosae strains, this prophage region was found only in LM1. Additionally, the prophages detected seem to create some genomic variations among the L. mucosae strains. However, non-phage elements in these regions are hypothetical proteins and are, thus, unknown.
Two exopolysaccharide (EPS) operons were identified within GI-2 and GI-12. GI-2 EPS is complemented by two glycosyl transferases, which are involved in the production of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and chondroitin sulfate. L . mucosae DPC 6426 produces EPS with mannosyl residues [26] . However, whether LM1 produces EPS or not has yet to be determined.
Self-defense and immune systems Restriction-modification (RM) systems and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) associated with CRISPR-associated genes, are some mechanisms by which bacteria resist phage infections [27] . Both are compatible, wherein the CRISPR-Cas system also cleaves invading DNA that were methylated by RM systems [28] . In L. mucosae LM1, only a few genes associated to type I and type III restriction endonuclease systems were found; whereas, two CRISPR-Cas loci (type I and type II), were detected in regions 1,305,291–1,315,478 bp, with 29 direct repeats (DRs) and 13 spacers, and 1,511,616–1,514,090 bp, with 36 DRs and 37 spacers. The information processing subsystem Cas1 (LBLM1_RS06065) and Cas2 (LBLM1_RS06060) genes are present in the first region along with the cascade complex component Cas3 (LBLM1_RS06095) gene. On the other hand, a putative Cas9 gene (LBLM1_RS07010) is found within the second region.
Phylogenetic analysis The carbohydrate metabolism of LM1 is similar to that of the type strain L. mucosae S32 T (DSM 13345), in terms of utilization of carbohydrates such as glucose, ribose, d -xylose, galactose, aesculin, melibiose, d -raffinose, and gluconate [5,8] . L . mucosae strains belong to the obligately heterofermentative group, together with one of the major Lactobacillus phylogenetic groups, the L. reuteri group, based on their 16s rRNA gene sequences (Fig. S3). The 16S rRNA sequences of the L. mucosae strains clustered with L. fermentum IFO 3956, Lactobacillus pontis LTH 2587, and L. reuteri JCM 1112, in agreement with a previous report [5] , but in a different branch from these species, as confirmed by ANI analysis. A discrepancy with closely related species such as L. fermentum and L. reuteri strains was detected ( Fig. 2 ), as evidenced by a < 72% ANI value by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. All L. mucosae strains studied here were phylogenetically similar by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Further, a species cut-off of 95% [29] was confirmed for all L. mucosae strains, with the rumen isolate strains KHPC15, KHPX11, and WCC8 showing lower ANI values than those of the type strain L. mucosae S32 T and LM1.
According to the ANI values, the complete genome of LM1 was most similar (97.72%) to that of the L. mucosae type strain S32 T (DSM 13345), which was also isolated from swine intestine [5] , followed by DPC 6426 from the bovine gastrointestinal tract (97.37%) [30] , Marseille from a patient with Kwashiorkor (97.32%) [31] , and the mannitol-producing strain CRL 573 (96.00%), which was isolated from child feces [32] . Such dissimilarities may be due to host-specific strain diversity and niche adaptation. Next, LM1 was subjected to a comparative genomic analysis with the other L. mucosae strains as well as L. reuteri and L. fermentum .
Comparative genomic analysis of L. mucosae LM1 Comparison of LM1 with other L. mucosae strains Initially, the sequencing quality and completeness of the draft genomes may have contributed to the differences in contig assembly among the L. mucosae strains. However, after re-aligning and re-assembling the contigs using MAUVE with the complete genome of LM1, comparison among the strains was possible as demonstrated by the genome-scale dotplots (Fig. S4), with internal conserved blocks and homologous genes considered for comparison among the L. mucosae strains.
Analysis of genome-scale dotplots using the complete LM1 genome as a reference (Fig. S4) indicated general synteny among the L. mucosae strains. However, the oriC positions varied among these strains, as shown in the whole genome MAUVE alignment ( Fig. 3 ); specifically, only LM1 had a plasmid (pLM1) prophage within the putative oriC site. Numerous chromosomal insertions, arrangements, and inversions were also detected by MAUVE alignment ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, even the L. mucosae strains KHPC15 and KHPX11, which originated from the same host (ruminant) and had perfect synteny (ANI value, 100%), showed a strain-specific chromosomal topology; an ~ 81 kb chromosomal inversion was present at positions 724,730–809,682 in KHPC15 and 698,767–783,145 in KHPX11 (Fig. S5). The variations were found to be due to the presence of numerous IS elements; indeed, prophage elements were identified in the genome of LM1 (see Section 2.3 ).
Putative integrases related to Staphylococcus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), such as LBLM1_RS02825, LBLM1_RS03880, LBLM1_RS05565, and LBLM1_RS07345, were found in the LM1 genome with specific phage elements. SaPIs reportedly have an intimate relationship with temperate phages, allowing these genomic islands to be encapsidated into small phage heads [33] . Of note, the integrase ORF LBLM1_RS02825 was part of P1, which was predicted by MAUVE alignment to have a conserved region that was likely translocated among the L. mucosae strains, with the exception of Marseille and DPC 6426. Further, a chromosomal inversion of the conserved block was present in KHPX11 ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). In Fig. 3 , color blocks 17 to 21 in KHPX11 and KHPC15 show the presence of P1 (block 18) between blocks 17 (blue) and 19, which are adjacent to each other in the other L. mucosae strains. The presence of transposases, including LBLM1_RS03940, LBLM1_RS03945, and LBLM1_RS04210 (putative transposases in the snaA - snaB intergenic region), may have a considerable impact on the functionality and expression of the genes involved with these transposable elements in LM1. Interestingly, genes in these blocks are essential for colonization of, and survival in, the gastrointestinal tract. These include a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, which is implicated in bile tolerance [34] ; enzymes involved in the maltose and glycogen metabolic pathways [35] and in the mevalonate pathway [36] , which may contribute to sugar utilization adaptation; and cell-surface protein-coding genes, such as choline-binding proteins and penicillin-binding proteins, which are implicated in adhesion [37] and maintaining peptidoglycan under bile stress [38] , respectively. Genes in the rearranged genome blocks of LM1 are summarized in Table S5 .

SaPIs reportedly have an intimate relationship with temperate phages, allowing these genomic islands to be encapsidated into small phage heads [33] . Of note, the integrase ORF LBLM1_RS02825 was part of P1, which was predicted by MAUVE alignment to have a conserved region that was likely translocated among the L. mucosae strains, with the exception of Marseille and DPC 6426. Further, a chromosomal inversion of the conserved block was present in KHPX11 ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). In Fig. 3 , color blocks 17 to 21 in KHPX11 and KHPC15 show the presence of P1 (block 18) between blocks 17 (blue) and 19, which are adjacent to each other in the other L. mucosae strains. The presence of transposases, including LBLM1_RS03940, LBLM1_RS03945, and LBLM1_RS04210 (putative transposases in the snaA - snaB intergenic region), may have a considerable impact on the functionality and expression of the genes involved with these transposable elements in LM1. Interestingly, genes in these blocks are essential for colonization of, and survival in, the gastrointestinal tract. These include a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, which is implicated in bile tolerance [34] ; enzymes involved in the maltose and glycogen metabolic pathways [35] and in the mevalonate pathway [36] , which may contribute to sugar utilization adaptation; and cell-surface protein-coding genes, such as choline-binding proteins and penicillin-binding proteins, which are implicated in adhesion [37] and maintaining peptidoglycan under bile stress [38] , respectively. Genes in the rearranged genome blocks of LM1 are summarized in Table S5.
A rearrangement of a large genomic region at positions 971,200–1,116,880 and 576,650–613,070 in LM1 was detected by comparison with those of S32 T (485,600–628,245 and 980,305–1,019,760 of S32 T , respectively) ( Fig. 3 ). Putative genes in this region also include P1 in the latter region, and insertional elements annotated as IS905 transposases with sequence homology to IS256 (LBLM1_RS02185 and LBLM1_RS02260), and this set of transposed regions is also present in S32 T . In the LM1 genome, internal transposases and transposons are also present in the former region, which may increase the plasticity of these conserved genomic blocks. Interestingly, a MUB (LBLM1_RS04610) is present in this region, and may be transported through a proximally-located Sec translocation system (LBLM1_RS04640-LBLM1_RS04660). Further, production of metabolic energy by malolactic fermentation may be mediated by the malate/lactate antiporter (LBLM1_RS04685) in this region, similar to L. plantarum [39] . Other orthologous genes involved in tolerance to acid, bile, and oxidative stress were also found in this region. The conserved orthologous genes in L. mucosae LM1 also present in the inverted genome blocks of KHPX11 and KHPC15 are summarized in Table S6 .

The conserved orthologous genes in L. mucosae LM1 also present in the inverted genome blocks of KHPX11 and KHPC15 are summarized in Table S6.
A prior tandem proteogenomic analysis and reconstruction of the metabolic pathways of LM1 [15] provided insight into the mechanisms by which L. mucosae tolerates environmental stress, maintains cellular integrity, and adheres to mucosal components [14,40] . Acidic and oxidative stress result in activation of cell membrane biosynthesis and repair of the peptidoglycan layer. Moreover, upregulation of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes such as glycosyl hydrolase family 65 protein ( GSH65 ; LBLM1_RS04255), xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase ( Xfp ; LBLM1_RS0385), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( 6PGDH ; LBLM1_RS00305), enables use of various carbohydrates, such as maltose and trehalose. GSH65 is adjacent to P1 in block 17, which is involved in maltose and glycogen metabolism.
The absence of ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase ( PfkA ) and FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase ( DhnA ) from the L. mucosae genomes suggests that Xfp activity may be important for redirection of energy production via the phosphoketolase pathway [41] . Use of other carbon sources was suggested by the presence of other enzymes, such as β-glucosidase (LBLM1_17760), glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase (LBLM1_17810), and pectinesterase (LBLM1_04470). Upregulation of CitT (LBLM1_00930) facilitates citrate uptake, which generates malate and succinate, important byproducts that can be used as an energy source by host intestinal cells [15] . These findings provide evidence for the mechanisms that allow LM1 to survive in carbohydrate-depleted environments.
Pan-genomic analysis of LM1 with other L. mucosae strains and closely related Lactobacillus species Glycogen metabolism
To confer beneficial effects on the host, the viability and prolonged retention of probiotics in the gut are important. Therefore, genes related to stress tolerance and starvation, colonization, and gut persistence were analyzed. Interestingly, a complete glycogen metabolism ( glg ) operon was present in the LM1 genome ( Fig. 4 ). The glycogen biosynthetic pathway is involved in energy production [42] , environmental stress tolerance [43,44] , biofilm formation [45] , and colonization and environmental persistence [35,46–48] . Glycogen is used by bacteria to store carbohydrates and enable colonization of diverse niches [49,50] . Although the complete glg operon is also present in some Lactobacillus spp. from mammalian and natural environments [51,52] , it was incomplete in other L. mucosae strains, and absent from L. reuteri JCM 1112 and L. fermentum IFO 3956 ( Fig. 3 ).
Furthermore, activation of the glg operon during early stationary phase growth of L. mucosae LM1 [15] suggests involvement in mucosa-associated, niche-specific adaptation, which provides ecological and competitive advantages. The reason for the absence of this operon in some isolates from mammalian hosts is unclear, but may be due to their preferences for other carbohydrates for carbon storage.
Folate biosynthesis in L. mucosae species Comparison of the genomes of L. mucosae LM1 and L. fermentum IFO 3956 revealed a folate producer, indicating that LM1 can synthesize folate, which is an essential cofactor in all living cells [53] . LM1 exhibits a complete folate biosynthetic pathway ( Fig. 5 ) and uses para-aminobenzoic acid, an intermediate of folate biosynthesis, via the shikimate pathway [54] . This gene set was also found in L. reuteri JCM 1112, but this strain lacks dihydrofolate synthase/folylpolyglutamate synthase ( folC ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ), which are essential for producing tetrahydrofolate. Folate produced in the intestine by lactic acid bacteria is used by the colonic epithelium, and prevents inflammation and colonic cancer [55] . Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus , another folate producer, is added to dairy products to increase their folate content [56] . The conditions under which LM1 produces folate should be the focus of further studies.
Neopullulanase and its prebiotic functions Genome mining of LM1 revealed genes encoding α- and β-galactosidases, β-glucuronidases, β-fructosidases (levansucrases), and α-amylases, which are involved in the production of prebiotic substances. We isolated an α-amylase gene (LBLM1_RS010140) and found that it encoded a neopullulanase. Overexpression of this gene in E. coli showed that the neopullulanase can degrade pullulan to generate the prebiotic panose, an isomaltooligosaccharide used by beneficial intestinal bacteria [57] . This was the first neopullulanase cloned from lactic acid bacteria, with others cloned and characteracterised from in Bacillus sp. [58,59] and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 95-1 [60] . Interestingly, BLAST analysis of the LM1 neopullulanase gene aligns with high identity and similarity to the other L. mucosae alpha-glycosidases (> 97%), but only around 78% query coverage to the neopullulanase found in rumen isolates, but still at a high identity. Significant hits with alpha-glycosidases and neopullulanases in other Lactobacillus sp. shows < 69% identity, and lower coverage, showing some diversity of this enzyme among LAB. Nevertheless, the ability of LM1 to produce panose, and its presence in many L. mucosae strains suggests the utility of L. mucosae strains as a prebiotic-producing-probiotic, as most possess this gene [61] .
Cell surface adhesins and other adhesion factors that may mediate host-microbe cross talk Bacterial adhesion to specific glycoprotein receptors in mucus is important because mucus functions as a natural barrier to protect gut epithelial cells. Lee et al. [11] identified a MUB homologue in the LM1 genome, and LM1 reportedly has an affinity for glycoreceptors on porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) [10] . Although most L. mucosae genomes contain a MUB homologue [5,11,31] , L . mucosae CRL 573 and DPC 6426 possess a truncated form [30,32] , which has high homology with a mucin-binding protein (MucBP) domain. Other adhesins may facilitate adhesion to gut epithelial cells; e.g. , putative collagen-binding proteins and fibronectin-binding protein in DPC 6426 [30] .
BLASTp analysis of the complete genome of LM1 also identified MucBP proteins (LBLM1_RS02150 and LBLM1_RS04140); these are glycosylated streptococcal protein B (GspB) homologues with affinity for sialic acid residues in mucins [62] . The GspB platelet-binding protein from Streptococcus gordonii is glycosylated in the serine-rich SSR1 and SSR2 regions with glucose, N -acetylglucosamine, and to a lesser extent galactose and N -acetylgalactosamine [63] .
MucBP domain searching revealed the presence of two putative internalin-like proteins (LBLM1_RS07130 and LBLM1_RS06500), which have high homology with mucus-binding domains, suggesting some functional similarities. These internalin-like proteins have an LPXTG motif, and their amino acid sequence is similar to that of the leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins of Listeria monocytogenes and the MucBPs of other Lactobacillus spp. Von Ossowski et al. [64] identified an ORF (LGG_02337), which was previously annotated as Internalin J, in the commercial probiotic L. rhamnosus GG. The purified form of this surface protein readily adhered to human intestinal mucus. Further, this protein has an L-type lectin domain, suggesting that it mediates adhesion to glycoreceptors on the surface of host cells.
A 2.2 kb operon that showed similarity and synteny with the mucus adhesion-promoting protein ( mapA ) operon (AJ293860.1) from L. reuteri [65] is present in the draft genome sequence of LM1 [8] . MapA is an adhesion protein that is degraded into an antimicrobial peptide [65] . The ORFs in this operon, which correspond to the MapA region, include LBLM1_RS05045 to LBLM1_RS05055.
Lam29, an adhesin-like protein specific to blood group A and B antigens, was originally identified in L. mucosae ME-340 [66,67] ; homologues of this protein are present in LM1 (LBLM1_RS02430) and other L. mucosae strains. These should be the subject of further studies on the interaction of L. mucosae strains with the host.
Core genome of L. mucosae strains and closely related Lactobacillus species Large areas in the heat map in Fig. 6 delineate the orthologous and paralogous differences among the genomes of the species and strains analyzed in this study. The presence of horizontally transferred genomic islands and prophages, such as P1/GI-3 and P3/GI-9 to GI-11, are major differences among the strains and species. However, a core genome functionally rich in various metabolic pathways, such as proteins, amino acids and derivatives, carbohydrates, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, and pigments (Fig. S6) provides a competitive advantage to L. mucosae and likely other gut bacteria by enabling production of diverse metabolites. In addition, the common pathways in L. mucosae spp., L. reuteri , and L. fermentum suggest the potential use of L. mucosae as a probiotic and as a component of synbiotics.
In conclusion, our comparative analysis of the complete genome of L. mucosae LM1, which is the first to be performed on L. mucosae , with other L. mucosae strains and closely related species enhances our understanding of its role in the gut and the mechanisms by which it colonizes and persists therein. Identification of the folate and glycogen biosynthetic pathways and alternative energy routes suggested the means by which L. mucosae survives in the harsh environment of the gut. It is interesting to observe that in comparison to the closest complete genome representative strains of L. fermentum sp. and L. reuteri sp., L. fermentum utilizes specific pathways present in L. fermentum that L. reuteri lacks or is incomplete in. In this respect, along with the ANI values, L. mucosae seems to be more genotypically closer and functionally similar to L. fermentum compared to L. reuteri , despite having common essential genes such as the MUB gene. These pathways are present in analyzed L. mucosae strains and are, therefore, deemed common among them. Furthermore, genes encoding adhesion and colonization factors likely enhance gut persistence and competitiveness, which also seem common among the L. mucosae strains. These factors are associated with the beneficial effect of LM1, which requires establishment in, and symbiosis with, the host.
Materials and methods Growth conditions and genomic DNA preparation L . mucosae LM1 was grown in 5 mL de Man–Rogosa–Sharpe (MRS) broth (Difco, Pont-de-Claix, France) at 37 °C under static conditions for 24 h. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. DNA quality was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA concentration and purity (A 260 /A 280 ) were measured using an Optizen Nano Q (Mecasys, Daejeon, Korea).
Genome sequencing and assembly The draft genome sequence of L. mucosae LM1 was determined to enable genome mining of probiotic genes ( Table S3 ) [11] . The whole genome shotgun (WGS) project was deposited in the GenBank database under the WGS sequencing project accession number AHIT00000000.1 in February 2012. It was superseded by the GenBank accession records, CP011013.1–CP011014.1 , which were used to generate the comparative genomics data presented here. Complete genome sequencing was performed by ChunLab, Inc. (Seoul, Korea), and a more detailed and updated analysis of the data is presented in this article.

The complete genome of L. mucosae LM1 was sequenced on 454 Titan PE 8 K, Illumina 100 PE, and PacBio 10 K sequencing platforms, and yielded 16.31 × (200,748 reads), 1002.38 × (22,807,602 reads), and 149.19 × (150,292 reads) coverage, respectively, for a total sequencing depth of 1167.89 ×. Genome assembly was performed using Roche gsAssembler 2.6, CLC bio CLC Genomics Workbench 6.5, and SMRT Analysis 2.0.0, and gap closing was performed using CodonCode Aligner 3.7. The final assemblies resulted in two contigs with a total length of 2.43 megabase pairs (Mbp; 46.13% GC ratio).
Genome annotation Coding sequences (CDS) were predicted by Glimmer 3.02 [68] . Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) were identified by tRNA-Scan-SE [69] , and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) were searched using HMMER with the EzTaxon-e rRNA profiles [70,71] . The predicted protein CDSs were compared to the Catalytic Families (CatFam) and NCBI Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) databases by rpsBLAST and to the NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq) and SEED databases by BLASTp for functional annotation [72–75] . Restriction-modification (R-M) system and the CRISPR-Cas loci were predicted from these annotations. Following, CRISPR direct repeats (DRs) and spacers were identified using CRISPRFinder ( http://crispr.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr /) [76–78] .
Prophage regions were predicted, and figures were generated, using PHAST ( http://phast.wishartlab.com ) [79] . As submitted to NCBI, each contig, one for the chromosome and one for the plasmid, was subjected to analysis using PHAST to predict the completeness of the prophage regions, and to identify and map their elements. Insertion sequence (IS) elements were predicted using IS Finder software ( http://issaga.biotoul.fr/issaga_index.php ) [80] . Genomic islands were predicted using IslandPath and SIGI-HMM, which is part of IslandViewer4 [81] , to identify regions with evidence of horizontal transfer.
The subcellular localization of proteins was predicted using SignalP 4.1 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP ) [82] and TMHMM 2.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM ) [83] . Lipoproteins were identified among the latter using LipoP 1.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP ) [84] .
Phylogenetic inference and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis Using the 16s rRNAs from the complete genomes of representative strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method [85] , using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) 7.0 software [86] . The tree included 21 representative Lactobacillus strains and Bifidobacterium breve as an outgroup, in comparison with the eight L. mucosae strains with available genomes in the NCBI database.
Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis was performed to determine the relationship of L. mucosae species with other species as predicted by 16s rRNA analysis, and to evaluate the species cut-off (< 95%) among the L. mucosae strains included in this comparative analysis. ANI values were predicted using the ANI calculator available on the EzGenome website, provided by Chunlab, Inc. [87] .
Comparative genomics MAUVE software was used to reassemble the contigs of the draft L. mucosae genomes available in the NCBI database using the complete genome of L. mucosae LM1 as a reference [88] . The draft genomes included the strains CRL573 ( NZ_JROC00000000.1 ), DPC 6426 ( NZ_JSWI00000000.1 ), Marseille ( NZ_CVQW00000000.1 ), and the type strain S32 T , also known as L. mucosae DSM 13345 ( NZ_AZEQ01000089.1 ) [49] . We also included the newly available draft genomes of L. mucosae strains KHPX11 ( NZ_FOSI00000000.1 ), KHPC15 ( NZ_FNZY00000000.1 ), and WCC8 ( NZ_FNIH00000000.1 ), which were submitted as part of the WGS sequencing project of the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. After reassembly, whole-genome sequencing alignments were performed using progressiveMauve [89] , annotated, and analyzed. Dot plot matrices were generated using these reassembled contigs against the complete genome of LM1 using Gepard software [90] . The MAUVE and Gepard alignments predict chromosomal rearrangement events such as insertion, inversion, and translocation, and combine them with the data from IS Finder and PHAST. Further, genetic comparisons of the completed LM1 genome with other published L. mucosae draft genomes were performed by all- vs. -all BLAST and HMMER searching of Pfam domains.
Additionally, comparative genomics was performed based on the bioinformatics pipeline and protocol of Chun et al. [91] . The complete genomes of the closely related strains L. fermentum IFO 3956 ( NC_010610.1 ) and L. reuteri JCM 1112 ( NC_010609.1 ) [92] were compared with that of L. mucosae LM1. Two L. mucosae draft genomes, strains CRL 573 and DPC 6426 from bovine gut, were included in the comparison of whole genome sequences with L. fermentum and L. reuteri . ANI values were used to produce a dendrogram using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). Homologous regions between the compared genomes were determined using the BLASTN software built-in to CLGenomics™, and aligned using a pairwise global alignment algorithm [93] . From this, the core genome was extracted and re-annotated for common functional groups using the RAST server [94] .
