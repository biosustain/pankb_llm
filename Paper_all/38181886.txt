Title: Comparative genomics and characterization of a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii VRL-M19 isolated from a crowded setting in India
Abstract: A crowded vegetable market serves as a mass gathering, posing a potential risk for infection transmission. In this study, we isolated a multidrug-resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii strain, VRL-M19, from the air of such a market and conducted comparative genomics and phenotypic characterization. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, genome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq X10, and pan-genome analysis with 788 clinical isolates identified core, accessory, and unique drug-resistant determinants. Mutational analysis of drug-resistance genes, virulence factor annotation,
in vitro pathogenicity assessment, subsystem analysis, Multilocus sequence typing, and whole genome phylogenetic analysis were performed. VRL-M19 exhibited multidrug resistance with 69 determinants, and analysis across 788 clinical isolates and 350 Indian isolates revealed more accessory genes (52 out of 69) in the Indian isolates. Multiple mutations were observed in drug target modification genes, and the strain was identified as a moderate biofilm-former with 55 virulence factors. Whole genome phylogenetics indicated a close relationship between VRL-M19 and clinical
A. baumannii strains. In conclusion, our comprehensive study suggests that VRL-M19 is a multidrug-resistant, potential pathogen with biofilm-forming capabilities, closely associated with clinical
A. baumannii strains. Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a rising global concern and a multifarious problem. One health approach for the containment of AMR required an expanded approach. In India, the rate of AMR has increased in humans, animals, and the environment disproportionally in the past few years. Such a scenario poses a challenge for the containment of AMR and 'India may become the AMR capital of the world’( Taneja and Sharma, 2019 ). Multidrug resistance (MDR) is persistently expanding with time in diverse ecosystems. Most of such observations are made in clinical isolates followed by environmental strains. It is now well acknowledged that in order to understand the evolutionary route from environmental to opportunistic pathogen lifestyle, as seen in Acinetobacter baumannii ( A. baumannii ), it is imperative to characterize A. baumannii in natural reservoirs. There is still a considerable gap in understanding the dispersion of AMR genes among populations and the dynamics of outbreaks in non-clinical settings, such as the mass gathering of the human population. According to WHO, a mass gathering is defined as an occasion of a large number of people either organized or spontaneous events in a confined space and time ( Memish et al., 2019 ). Several reports suggest that mass gathering is one of the social activities provoking the transmission of pathogens among the population in a defined environment ( Gautret and Steffen, 2016 ; Leangapichart et al., 2016 ; Wharton et al., 1990 ). There are various reports of clinical isolates of A. baumannii across different regions in India. A study in Sitapura, Jaipur, Rajasthan, reveals a high prevalence of A. baumannii strains, with a majority exhibiting resistance to multiple antibiotics, classifying it as an emerging hospital-acquired pathogen ( Sharma et al., 2018 ). Another study in Varanasi highlights the increasing emergence of A. baumannii in hospital-acquired pneumonia, with a significant proportion showing resistance to imipenem ( Banerjee et al., 2018 ). Limited studies in the Punjab region also indicate antibiotic resistance, with A. baumannii isolates from Chandigarh displaying resistance to meropenem and imipenem ( Vijayakumar et al., 2019 ). These studies underscore the diverse geographical distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of A. baumannii infections in different regions of India.
In the current study, an A. baumannii strain VRL-M19 was isolated from the air of a crowded fruit and vegetable market where >1200 persons gathered at a time, which could be a favorable niche for the transfer of aerosols (containing microorganisms from the oral cavities and respiratory tracts), among the attendees, during involuntary activities such as coughing, sneezing, respiratory activities and etc. Such activities enhance the chance of transmission of human visceral microbiota among individuals as well as into the environment ( da Silva Nali et al., 2016 ; Sebastiaan J van Hal et al., 2009 ). A. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen known to cause various lethal infections. It shows tolerance to wide ranges of pH, humidity, and temperature, and is also able to survive on dry surfaces for several months which can cause serious outbreak infections ( Almaghrabi et al., 2018 ). A. baumannii emerged as a significant multidrug-resistant pathogen worldwide and its resistance increasingly reported during the last decade. Resistant A. baumannii is an emerging challenge due to its resistance patterns to most of the antibiotics widely used in the treatment of A. baumannii infection ( Singh et al., 2013 ). Available literature reported the resistance profile of A. baumannii against a significant number of antibiotics ( Badave and Dhananjay, 2015 ; Singh et al., 2013 ; Vrancianu et al., 2020 ). Though several studies have indicated an upward trend in the prevalence of MDR A. baumannii , the evolutionary rate of resistance varies widely depending on its habitat ( Yadav et al., 2020 ).
A. baumannii , a nosocomial, is opportunistic ESKAPE pathogens ( Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Enterobacter species), which acquired significant clinical attention due to its rapid increase in multidrug resistance ( Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016 ). Whereas, the studies about its occurrence as a potential reservoir in environmental and non-clinical settings are obscure. Horizontal gene transfer of drug-resistant determinants among the environmental and clinical strains may be one of the sources for the persistent genetic modifications in the genome of A. baumannii, which is prone to acquiring drug resistance. Hence, it is important to study the MDR A. baumannii strain isolated from diverse environments to understand its drug-resistant profiles and pathogenesis. In view of this, in the current study, we report the genetic characterization and comparative assessment of MDR A. baumannii VRL-M19 isolated from an open-air environment. Comparative genomic analysis of VRL-M19 with 788 strains of A. baumannii reveals the presence of several virulence factors, drug resistance determinants, and mutations among the genes associated with the target modification resistance mechanism.
Material and methods Isolation and identification Strain VRL-M19 was isolated from air by the settle plate method at an open-air vegetable and fruit market of sector 40 A, Chandigarh, India (30°73′93” N, 76°73′24″ E). For air sampling, various sterile media in Petri plates (such as MacConkey agar, Reasoner's 2 A agar (R2A), actinomycetes isolation agar, yeast mannitol agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar, tryptone soy agar, cetrimide agar base, eosin methylene blue agar, Lewenstein Jensen agar, gelatin agar, brain heart infusion agar, soil extract agar, and potato dextrose agar, Streptomyces agar) were exposed to the open area of the market for 3–4 h and then plates were incubated for 24–72 h at 37 °C in the laboratory. Various bacterial colonies grown on plates were picked based on the morphological variation and further purified on the respective media. Based on the antimicrobial resistance pattern of isolated strains, strain VRL-M19 has been selected for further characterization. Strain VRL-M19 was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing by using a pair of universal bacterial primers i. e. 27F’ (5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R’ (5’-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACT- 3′) ( Weisburg et al., 1991 ; Yoon et al., 2017 ).
Antibiotic susceptibility testing The antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) of VRL-M19 was determined using the disk diffusion method, conducted on Mueller-Hinton agar plates ( Tenover, 2019 ). The antibiogram was executed against a panel of 37 antibiotics belonging to 12 classes, including four antibiotic-adjuvant combinations as specified in Table 1 . The results were interpreted based on the zone of inhibition as per the guidelines available in the Clinical Laboratory and Standard Institute ( Weinstein and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2023 ).
Genome sequencing, quality assessment, and annotation For genomic characterization, whole genome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq X10 sequencing platform via paired-end 2 × 150 base pair (bp) chemisty and the resultant reads were assembled by Unicycler assembler with default k-mer sizes. The genome sequence of A. baumannii ATCC 17978-mff ( NZ_CP012004.1 ) was used as a reference strain for comparative analysis in the current study ( Zhou et al., 2021 ). Contig re-ordering and alignment were done using Mauve Contig Mover (MCM) followed by a quality check by QUAST 5.0.2. The parameter–strict -NA of QUAST 5.0.2 was used to compute NAx and NGAx statistics ( Mikheenko et al., 2018 ; Rissman et al., 2009 ). As per EUCAST (European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) criteria, genome fraction of ≥75%, NGA50 ≥ 20000, and the number of contigs ≤500 was used to assess the quality of VRL-M19 draft genome sequence ( Ellington et al., 2017 ; Rissman et al., 2009 ). The resulting genome was annotated by using the RASTtk and the subsystem mapping was done using the online RAST server ( Brettin et al., 2015 ).
Identification of IS elements The genome of VRL-M19 is scanned for insertion sequence (IS) elements using the ISEscan tool which provides the ORF coordinates for complete, as well as partial IS elements across the genome sequence and in-house algorithm in PERL ( https://github.com/tinabioinfo/VRL-M19/blob/main/Code_to_cover_DR_genes_with_IS_elements ) was designed to map the genomic location of IS elements with respect to the drug resistance determinants ( Xie and Tang, 2017 ).
MLST and phylogenetic tree construction Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of the VRL-M19 was done via the online MLST (2.0.4) tool of the Center for Genomic Epidemiology ( https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MLST/ ) using both Pasteur and Oxford schemes. The server used the database of PubMLST.org ( Larsen et al., 2012 ). For genome sequence-based phylogenetic tree construction, 53 genomes of A. baumannii were downloaded from the NCBI (based on 16S gene similarity), and the genome of the Sequence type (ST624) was retrieved from the PubMLST database. A total of 55 genomes of A. baumannii including VRL-M19 were used to create a dendrogram by using the PATRIC online server (3.6.12). The codon tree used amino acid and coding DNA of PATRIC (PGFams) protein family across the chosen genome group and aligned the protein sequences using MUSCLE, and the coding DNA with the codon align function of Biopython. Finally, the aligned sequences were analyzed by the program RAxML (Maximum likelihood-based phylogeny) using 100 rounds of “bootstrapping” ( Antonopoulos et al., 2019 ).
Identification of virulence factors The VFDB database and PATRIC were used to identify the virulence factors of strain VRL-M19 ( Antonopoulos et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2016 ). From the VFDB database, the protein sequences of virulence factors for A. baumannii were retrieved and aligned with the CDSs of VRL-M19 with ≥ 50% percentage identity, ≥ 90% query coverage and 0.0001 e-value using BLASTp. The operon prediction was done using the fgenesB tool ( http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesb&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb ) with 11 genetic code and the closest organism ‘bacterial generic’ and all the predicted virulence factor genes were mapped to the operons of VRL-M19. The order of the virulence factors was cross-checked with the operons of the reference strain A. baumannii ATCC 17978-mff (NZ_CP012004.1 ) predicted using the fgenesB tool. BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) was used to create a circular image for the visualization of the order and position of virulence factors over the VRL-M19 genome ( Alikhan et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, the whole genome of VRL-M19 has also been checked for the presence of pathogenic protein families by using an online Pathogen Finder (version 1.1) tool ( https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/PathogenFinder/ ) to assess its pathogenesis in humans ( Cosentino et al., 2013 ).
Identification of drug resistance genes Identification of drug resistance (DR) genes/determinants was done using PATRIC, CARD, ResFinder, PRAP, and ABRicate ( Antonopoulos et al., 2019 ; Bortolaia et al., 2020 ; Feldgarden et al., 2019 ; He et al., 2020 ; Jia et al., 2017 ). The PRAP tool was used to scan the VRL-M19 genome against CARD and Resfinder with 50% percentage identity and ≥ 90% query coverage for protein sequences of VRL-M19. The ABRicate tool was used to scan the VRL-M19 contigs against CARD and NCBI databases.
Pangenome analysis of drug resistance genes For the pangenome analysis of drug resistance genes in Acinetobacter baumannii , a comprehensive dataset of 788 high-quality genome sequences was assembled, featuring clinical isolates renowed for their pathogenicity in humans and documented MIC values following CLSI standards. The selection process incorporated good quality metrics with CheckM contamination below 5% and CheckM completeness above 90%. These genomes were sourced from the NCBI and PATRIC databases, as detailed in previous studies ( Antonopoulos et al., 2019 ; Sayers et al., 2022 ). Additionally, a curated set of 350 high-quality genomes from India, encompassing 39 complete genomes and 311 WGS sequences, was scrutinized. The resistance profiles of these Indian isolates were obtained from PATRIC (reported as computational methods (AdaBoost)). Both datasets, along with VRL-M19, were subjected to pangenome analysis using the BPGA (Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis tool) pipeline, applying default parameters as described in earlier works ( Chaudhari et al., 2016 ; Sharma et al., 2022 ).
Mutational and domain analysis of core drug resistance genes The core target modifications drug resistance genes obtained from pangenome analysis from all the selected clinical isolates of A. baumannii and VRL-M19 were aligned using ClustalW ( Thompson et al., 1994 ). The resulting fasta format alignment file was subjected to variation analysis using an snp-sites tool which generated a vcf file with mutations mapped on VRL-M19 based on the reference genome ( Page et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, domain analysis was performed using the Pfam 34.0 database with an E value of 1.0 to evaluate the impact of point mutations found in drug resistance genes that are associated with the target modification mechanism ( Finn et al., 2014 ).
Invitro pathogenesis assays To evaluate the phenotypic pathogenicity of the VRL-M19 strain, in vitro assays were performed.
Biofilm formation The ability of A. baumannii to adhere to abiotic surfaces to form biofilm is one of the important factors that supports its pathogenesis ( Eijkelkamp et al., 2011 ; Gedefie et al., 2021 ). The biofilm formation of A. baumannii VRL-M19 was analyzed in a microtiter plate biofilm assay ( Zeighami et al., 2019 ). Briefly, the culture was grown overnight in tryptic soy broth with 0.25% of glucose at 37 °C. The free cells were removed and the biofilms were washed thrice with Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and fixed with 99% (v/v) methanol. The wells were further stained with 1% (v/v) of crystal violet at room temperature for 20 min. The Crystal violet was dissolved using ethanol/acetone (80,20, v/v) for 20 min and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm. The assay was done in technical triplicates and biological duplicates of the VRL-M19 culture. The biofilm formation was measured as per the optical density (O·D) as follows: non-biofilm former (<1.0), weak biofilm former (1.0–2.0), moderate biofilm former (2.0–3.0), strong biofilm former (>3.0).
Motility Motility is often associated with bacterial virulence in various bacterial strains ( Han et al., 2008 ; Alarcon et al., 2009 ) and has also been reported in several clinical isolates of A.baumannii ( Eijkelkamp et al., 2011 ). Motility was analyzed by the swimming agar plate method. For this, LB media and 0.3% agar plate were prepared. A bacterial culture of VRL-M19, which was grown overnight, was used for the motility analysis. Using a sterile micropipette, 3 μL of the VRL-M19 culture was carefully placed in the center of the LB agar plate. This inoculation at the center allows for the observation and measurement of bacterial motility as the bacteria move outward from the point of inoculation. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.To validate the motility assay, a non-motile culture of Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 1430 was used as a negative control. The plates were examined for the presence and pattern of bacterial motility. Motile bacteria typically exhibit outward migration from the point of inoculation, creating a visible “swimming” pattern in the agar ( Harding et al., 2013 ).
Results and discussion In this study, we report a unique strain of A. baumannii , named VRL-M19, isolated from an air sample. Both the antibiotic susceptibility test and genomics characterization of this strain are performed to map the drug resistance profile as well its phenotypic resistance. To gain further insights into the strain genotype, virulence genes, MLST, and phylogeny affiliations were analyzed. Further, the pangenome analysis is performed with around 788 clinical isolates of A. baumannii . Observations from various characterization techniques are reported below.
Isolation and identification of VRL-M19 Strain VRL-M19 was isolated from an air sample collected at a crowded fruit and vegetable market, Sector 40, Chandigarh, India. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and whole genome DNA-DNA hybridization of VRL-M19 with A. baumannii ATCC 19606 T showed 99.9% and 99.3% respectively, which confirmed the taxonomic affiliation of VRL-M19 to A. baumannii . Further, the antibiotyping of VRL-M19 is studied extensively and explored the genotype-phenotype correlations. The genome sequence and 16S rRNA gene sequences of A. baumannii VRL-M19 have been deposited to GenBank under accession no. JAHLEI000000000.1 and OQ692086.1 respectively.
Antibiotic resistance profile of VRL-M19 Strain VRL-M19 showed phenotypic resistance to eight antibiotics belonging to seven different classes such as beta-lactam, sulphonamide, macrolide, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, monobactam, and cephalosporin ( Table 1 ). While it was susceptible to 29 antibiotics (including 4 antibiotic-adjuvant combinations) among a total of 37 antibiotics that were used for AST in this study ( Table 1 ). VRL-M19 is found to be a MDR A. baumannii based on its resistance pattern.
Genome assembly and annotation of VRL-M19 The whole genome was assembled into a scaffold of 39 30,429 bp length, with a G + C content of 38.93%. The QUAST analysis resulted in 18 contigs with a length of at least ≥ 1000 bp for each contig. The largest contig was found to be a length of 636,544 bp. The genome quality was determined by metrics of NGA50(=31,917), and Genome fraction (85.879%), which fulfilled the criteria of a good-quality genome as recommended by EUCAST. Global alignments were visualized via MCM as locally collinear blocks (LCBs), which represent the regions with homology without any rearrangement between genomes. LCBs are colored according to the homology of the reference genome ( Fig. 1 ). A total of 19 LCBs that correspond to the homologous regions that are shared by the two genome sequences were observed.
IS elements in VRL-M19 genome ISEscan analysis of the concatenated and re-ordered contigs of strain VRL-M19 has shown four insertion sequence (IS) elements corresponding to three families: IS481 (IS481_30|IS481||protein: vir:99858 (start position:1421755, end position:1423512)), IS481 (IS481_213 (start position:2775736, end position:2776921)), IS21 (IS21_259 (start position:3891202, end position:3892965)), IS3 (IS3_61 (startposition:3928991, end position:3930373)). An in-house Perl algorithm did not identify any of these IS elements occurring at 1000 bp upstream of the identified drug resistance determinants. This observation indicates the absence of IS element nearby any of these drug resistance genes of VRL-M19.
Sequence typing and phylogeny of VRL-M19 MLST server assigns VRL-M19 to Sequence Type (ST) 624 based on only the Pasteur scheme. (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Two other strains, IOMTU501 and G20251192, of A. baumannii with ST624 were found in the PubMLST database, both of which were isolated from geographically distant origins while belonging to the same Sequence type. The whole genome phylogenetic tree revealed the closest cladding of VRL-M19 with various A. baumannii strains of clinical origin. Strain VRL-M19 shows the closest relationship with an A. baumannii strain isolated from the lower respiratory tract of a human being. Thus, MLST and phylogeny relation predicts its origin from a clinical setup. ( Fig. 2 ).
Subsystem mapping The RASTtk Pipeline was used for genome annotation and it predicted 3672 coding sequences (CDSs) and 69 RNAs. The RAST SEED server grouped only 44% of the protein-coding sequences (1640 genes out of 3672) into a functional subsystem in the VRL-M19 genome. These 1640 protein-coding sequences were mapped to 309 subsystems, of which amino acids and derivatives ( n = 281 CDSs), protein metabolism ( n = 187), carbohydrates ( n = 177), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, and pigments ( n = 140), metabolism of aromatic compounds ( n = 98), membrane transport ( n = 86), respiration ( n = 82), fatty acids, lipids, and isoprenoids ( n = 78), nucleosides and nucleotides ( n = 71), stress response ( n = 64), DNA metabolism ( n = 56 ), RNA metabolism ( n = 50), sulfur metabolism ( n = 48), Miscellaneous ( n = 43), virulence, disease and defense ( n = 33), regulation and cell signaling ( n = 32), secondary metabolites ( n = 23), DNA metabolism (n = 56), etc. have been identified. The list of cellular processes and the distribution of protein-coding genes are shown in Fig. 3 .
The maximum length of the protein sequence annotated is 5181 amino acids long ( WP_216116445.1 ), which was predicted as a large exoprotein involved in heme utilization or adhesion. The large exoprotein is reported as a part of the Two partner system (TPS) family. TPS systems are known to be found among Gram-negative bacteria and are part of the Type Vb secretion system which is composed of two proteins, TpsB (AbFhaB), the outer membrane pore-forming transporter, and TpsA (AbFhaC), the cognate secreted exoprotein that is involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. This TPS system was also reported in one of the highly adhesive known clinical strains AbH12O-A2 of A. baumannii responsible for a large outbreak of nosocomial infection in Madrid (Spain) 2006–2008 and later it was found that the functional inactivation of this two-partner system significantly reduces the adherence of bacteria to the A549 alveolar epithelial cell ( Darvish Alipour Astaneh et al., 2014 ; Pérez et al., 2017 ; Sebastiaan J. van Hal et al., 2009 ). A channel-forming transporter/cytolysins activator of the TpsB family with a CDS length of 585 amino acids ( WP_000248748.1 ) was also found in strain VRL-M19. Thus, the presence of these two partner systems in VRL-M19 indicates the possibility that it might also have remarkable adhesion capacity to the surfaces that facilitate the biofilm formation but further phenotypic exploration of this secretion system is required in VRL-M19.
Virulence factors in VRL-M19 The analysis for the virulence factors using the VFDB database revealed the presence of 54 virulence factors in VRL-M19, in addition to the one gene that was identified using the Victor database (PATRIC3.6.9) (Supplementary Table 3). The distribution of 55 virulence genes that were aligned on the ordered contigs of VRL-M19 is shown in Fig. 4 . Among 55 virulence genes, 13 ( adeF , adeH , adeG , csuA , csuB , csuC , csuD , csuE , pgaA , pgaB , pgaC , pgaD , bap ) are known to be involved in biofilm formation and eight ( pgi , lpsB , lpxA, lpxB, lpxC, lpxD, lpxL, lpxM ) play role in immune evasion, nine virulence factors, namely, (genes ACICU_00071 (ATPase), ACICU_00072 (protein-tyrosine-phosphatase), ACICU_00073 (periplasmic protein), ACICU_00074 (UDP- N -acetyl-D-mannosaminuronate dehydrogenase), ACICU_00087 (sugar transferase), ACICU_00088 (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase), ACICU_00089 (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase), ACICU_00091 (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), ACICU_00092 (phosphomannomutase) and pgi are involved in immune invasion. A total of 16 genes (viz. barB, basA, basB, basC, basF, basG, basH, basI, basJ, bauA, bauB, bauC, bauD, bauE, bauF, entE ) code for iron-chelating molecules called siderophores. Two genes, bfmR , and bfmS , are part of a two-component system thus and have a significant role in adhesion and biofilm formation. Two other genes, abaI and abaR , are involved in quorum sensing and pbpG in serum resistance. Among the virulence factors, plc and plcD encode for Phospholipase C and Phospholipase D enzymes respectively. The ompA gene encodes for surface proteins which are known to mediate pathogenesis via interaction with epithelial cells, resulting in cytotoxicity. Gene ompA is also known to be majorly involved in adherence and biofilm formation. The BRIG image illustrates the distribution of virulence factors on the genome of VRL-M19, revealing the presence of seven clusters of virulence genes. Notably, six genes ( picD , ompA , lpxB , lpxM , lpxC , and bap ) are dispersed across the genome. OmpA also plays a crucial role in binding to human epithelial cells thus in adherence and biofilm formation ( Matar et al., 2017 ) ( Huang et al., 2016 ). Biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces involves the mediation of the pilus-related csuA , csuB , csuC , and csuD gene families, which are identified as annotated clusters in the VRL-M19 genome. ( Pakharukova et al., 2018 ). The A. baumannii VRL-M19 isolate was found to contain the pgaABCD gene cluster, which is known to encode a protein called poly-Beta-(1–6) N -acetylglucosamine (PNAG). This protein serves as a crucial virulence factor, playing a significant role in protecting the bacteria from the innate immune response of the host . ( Choi et al., 2009 ). The adeF , adeG and adeH genes were detected as a cluster in the VRL-M19 genome, which were known to have a correlation with the biofilm formation capabilities in the A. baumannii strains. The VRL-M19 genome harbors the largest cluster, comprising 16 genes, including barB , basA , basB , basC , basF , basG , basH , basI , basJ , bauA , bauB , bauC , bauD , bauE , bauF , and entE . This cluster is recognized for its involvement in the biosynthesis of acinetobactin, a siderophore iron acquisition system, and serves as a virulence factor crucial for pathogenesis in A. baumannii . ( Conde-Pérez et al., 2021 ; Sheldon and Skaar, 2020 ). Furthermore, based on the prediction from the pathogen finder tool, strain VRL-M19 was identified as a human pathogen with 0.861 probability and contained 655 pathogenic protein families. These are 100% similar to that of the other A. baumannii strains with the input proteome coverage of 18.29% of VRL-M19. The predicted proteins mainly belong to type IV secretory protein IcmF, Sensory box protein, GasS-like sensor kinase protein, glycerol-3-Phosphate acetyltransferase, and a few hypothetical proteins that are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of A. baumannii . Based on the presence of pathogenic protein families and virulence gene clusters, strain VRL-M19 could be predicted as a potential human pathogen.
Drug resistance genes in VRL-M19 A total of 69 drug resistance genes (18 genes from PRAP and 51 genes from CARD) were found in the VRL-M19 genome (Supplementary Table 4). Most of the genes (30) belong to antibiotic efflux pump such as emrE , adeL , adeF , adeG , adeH , WP_011859112. 1 (code for ABC transporter ATP-binding protein/permease (obsolete from NCBI)), acrB , envC , adeR , adeS, WP_011859328.1 (MFS transporter (obsolete from NCBI)), WP_000128703.1 (EmrA/EmrK family), emrB , lysR , craA , adeI , adeJ , adeK , WP_011860144.1 ( Bcr/CflA family (obsolete from NCBI), adeN , macA , ABO10989.2 (macrolide transport protein)), abeM , tolC, adeB , adeA , mexK , macB , abeS , oqxB while one gene i.e. soxR , belongs to both antibiotic efflux and target modification. There were 19 genes i.e. gyrA , lpxC , lpxA , lpxD , ABO12487.2, fabG , parC , parE , rpsJ , ethA , folP , fabI , thyA , katG , rpoB , murA , rpsL , fusA , aadA which belong to target modification. A total of six genes i.e. carO , OprD , WP_000848135.1 (carbohydrate porin (obsolete from NCBI), benP , quiX and WP_000910013.1 ( OprD family outer membrane porin (obsolete from NCBI)) belong to permeability defects, and five belong to antibiotic inactivation, adc-6 , oxa-51 , ant(3″)-II , aac(1)-I , add-A while for eight genes i.e. ftsK , estR , zapA , trm , recA , abrp , zipA and plsC , mechanism of resistance is not clearly understood so far.
Pan-genome and mutational analysis of drug resistance genes A pangenome analysis was conducted on 69 drug resistance genes of VRL-M19, comparing them with 788 global isolates and 350 Indian isolates. This analysis aimed to elucidate the distribution of core, accessory, and unique genes concerning VRL-M19. During the analysis involving 788 clinical isolates, 51 drug resistance genes were identified as part of the core group, while 18 were categorized as accessory genes. Notably, no unique gene was observed in the VRL-M19 isolate. Likewise, in the analysis of 350 Indian isolates, a total of 17 drug resistance genes were found in the core group, with 52 genes categorized as accessory. Given that VRL-M19 is an Indian isolate, it is noteworthy that the predominant resistance mechanism observed is antibiotic efflux, which is represented by a total of 30 genes. Among these, 18 were categorized as accessory genes, while 12 were identified as core genes.
Additionally, the pan-genome analysis performed on the 788 isolates, which are geographically distributed worldwide, reveals the existence of 18 core genes and 12 accessory genes among the 30 drug-resistance genes categorized under the antibiotic efflux resistance mechanism.
Among all accessory drug resistance genes, only soxR is characterized for conferring resistance via both antibiotic efflux and target modification resistance mechanisms ( Fig. 5 A ). It must be noted that all 18 accessory genes were significantly aligned with ≥740 clinical isolates of A. baumannii ( Fig. 5 B).
The genome of VRL-M19 has 19 drug resistance target modification genes out of which 12 genes were found to contain mutations based on variation analysis carried out with respect to the reference genome of A. baumannii 17,978-mff ( Table 2 ). Among 12 genes, parC and parE are known for their resistance against fluoroquinolones and folP for sulphonamide, VRL-M19 also exhibits a phenotypic resistance to these classes of drugs. The antibiotic norfloxacin (fluoroquinolones class) is widely being prescribed and is known to act by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication by binding to the DNA gyrase (encoded by gyrA gene) and topoisomerase IV (encoded by parC and parE genes). Interestingly, in VRL-M19 several novel mutations are observed that might be associated with its phenotypic resistance. In parC three mutations, namely, Glu-457– > Lys, Gly-468– > Ser, and Thr-625– > Ala, and in parE one mutation at Val-551– > Ile, are observed.
A crystal structure of topoisomerase IV ( PDB ID: 2XKK ) of A. baumannii with moxifloxacin explains the structural basis of resistance which depict the H-bonding of Ser at 84 position and Glu at 88 positions of topoisomerase with moxifloxacin and thus mutations at these residues in topoisomerase IV confer quinolone resistance in gram-negative bacteria ( Wohlkonig et al., 2010 ). In our analysis, a point mutation from acidic to the basic amino acid residue was also found in parC of VRL-M19 at 457 position (Glu-457– > Lys) which is not yet reported for the quinolones resistance but may play a role in quinolone resistance. Further, in Pfam sequence analysis, parC mutations map to subunit A of gyrase/topoisomerse IV, indicating a potential role of these mutations in quinolone resistance. However, further studies are required to establish their role in drug resistance.
Furthermore, mutations were also observed in folP (encodes sulfonamide-targeted enzyme Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS)). Analysis of folP of VRL-M19 for its resistance against Cotrimoxazole (SXT), a combination drug of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, led to the identification of 3 mutations (Arg-14– > Gly, Pro-130– > Ser, Met-280– > Ile) which were not reported earlier for A. baumannii . However, Met-280– > Ile mutation observed in VRL-M19 is reported in the literature for Streptococcus ( Buwembo et al., 2013 ). Further, during the Pfam analysis of folP gene, Pro-130– > Ser mapped to the functional domain of the pterin binding enzyme while none of the other mutations mapped to any functional domains. It may be hypothesized that alterations in the pterin-binding enzyme due to this mutation could play a role in resistance against sulfonamides ( Hevener et al., 2010 ; Patel et al., 2004 ). However, no reports of resistance to sulfonamides due to mutations in the pterin domain of the DHPS enzyme are found. It is important to note that there are several mechanisms of resistance to any antibiotic and only one such mechanism of target modification is explored in the current study.
In the pan-genome analysis of 788 isolates, a substantial portion of genes (51 out of 69) is designated as “Core,” signifying their conservation across diverse bacterial strains. Conversely, Indian isolates exhibit a higher number of genes (52 out of 69) classified as “Accessory,” suggesting potential variations in the gene pool or adaptations specific to the Indian context. Notably, a considerable number of genes classified as core in the 788 isolates are categorized as accessory in Indian isolates, indicating regional variations or specific adaptations. Comparative analysis reveal a significant divergence in gene classification between the 788 global isolates and 350 Indian isolates. Such divergence could be crucial for understanding regional differences in drug resistance and tailoring antibiotic strategies accordingly.
Evaluation of In vitro pathogenesis of VRL-M19 Biofilm formation The adherence capability of A. baumannii VRL-M19 to abiotic surfaces, specifically in terms of biofilm formation, was evaluated through the microtiter plate biofilm assay. The average of technical triplicates for both biological duplicates reveals that the absorbance at 595 nm is 2.738 for biological sample 1 and 2.680 for biological sample 2, falling within the range of 2 to 3. The findings indicate that A. baumannii VRL-M19 exhibited moderate biofilm-forming capabilities, suggesting a potential pathogenic nature for this strain (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Motility In the swimming agar plate method, strain A. baumannii VRL-M19 was moved from the center of the agar plate to the periphery in 24 h of incubation Whereas, this kind of motility was not observed for the nonmotile control strain S. aureus MTCC 1430. The visual observation of the relative moment of the culture from the center to the periphery of the plate determined that the strain VRL-M19 exhibited moderate twitching on-surface motility (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Conclusion Strain VRL-M19 isolated from a vegetable and fruit market is an MDR A. baumannii that has novel mutations in its drug resistance genes. Its genome analysis deciphers the presence of multiple clusters of virulence genes which were well reported in A. baumannii for its virulence and also predicted as a human pathogen. The Pan genome analysis indicated substantial regional divergence in the distribution of drug resistance genes. The phylogeny and MLST analysis revealed its close relation with a clinical isolate of A. baumannii . The presence of Two Partner System (TPS) in the VRL-M19 genome is known for its biofilm formation and adherence properties. Evaluation of in vitro assays supported the pathogenic potential of the strain. Though the strain VRL-M19 was isolated from the environmental sample, the genomic features endorse its affiliation with clinical strains. The findings from the study would give a way to achieve further milestones in exploring the new drug targets and also to understand the genetic changes due to the transmission of virulent and drug-resistant determinants among the environmental strains that lead to the emergence of more MDR pathogenic strains.
