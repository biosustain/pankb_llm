Extended genomic analyses of the broad-host-range phages vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii reveal slopekviruses have highly conserved genomes Open Access
ABSTRACT High levels of antimicrobial resistance among members of the Klebsiella oxytoca complex (KoC) have led to renewed interest in the use of bacteriophage (phage) therapy to tackle infections caused by these bacteria. In this study we characterized two lytic phages, vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii, that were isolated from sewage water against two GES-5-positive Klebsiella michiganensis strains (PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4, respectively). ViPTree analysis showed both phages belonged to the genus Slopekvirus. rpoB gene-based sequence analysis of 108 presumptive K. oxytoca isolates (n=59 clinical, n=49 veterinary) found K. michiganensis to be more prevalent (46 % clinical and 43 % veterinary, respectively) than K. oxytoca (40 % clinical and 6 % veterinary, respectively). Host range analysis against these 108 isolates found both vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii showed broad lytic activity against KoC species. Several hypothetical homing endonuclease genes were encoded within the genomes of both phages, which may contribute to their broad host range. Differences in the tail fibre protein may explain the non-identical host range of the two phages. Pangenome analysis of 24 slopekviruses found that genomes within this genus are highly conserved, with more than 50 % of all predicted coding sequences representing core genes at ≥95 % identity and ≥70 % coverage. Given their broad host ranges, our results suggest vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii represent attractive potential therapeutics. In addition, current recommendations for phage-based pangenome analyses may require revision.

Introduction Members of the Klebsiella oxytoca complex (KoC) are divided into phylogroups based on the sequence of their chromosomally encoded β-lactamase (blaOXY) gene. The current phylogroups are Klebsiella michiganensis (KoI, with KoV sub-lineage), K. oxytoca (KoII), K. spallanzanii (KoIII), K. pasteurii (KoIV), K. grimontii (KoVI) and K. huaxiensis (KoVIII). KoVII has been described based on a single isolate [1–3].
Several members of the KoC can cause a variety of infections in humans including urinary tract infections, septicaemia and Clostridioides-negative antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis [4–6]. The rapid development of antimicrobial resistance and the lack of novel antibiotics is a serious public health concern. Of 41 strains of the KoC isolated from bloodstream infections in the UK and Ireland, 100 % were phenotypically resistant to amoxicillin and cefuroxime, 75.6 % to piperacillin-tazobactam, 73.2 % to amoxicillin-clavulanate and 48.8 % to ciprofloxacin [7]. In a survey of 5724 clinical isolates of K. oxytoca, the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme identified rates of non-susceptibility of K. oxytoca to various antibiotics: 1.8 % carbapenems, 12.5 % ceftriaxone, 7.1 % ciprofloxacin, 0.8 % colistin and 0.1 % tigecycline [8]. GES-positive clinical strains of the KoC have also been identified recently [9, 10].
KoC bacteria can also cause disease in animals. Of 336 samples collected from companion animals, 11 (3.3 %) isolates were identified as K. oxytoca. These were typically recovered from the urogenital system and 81.8 % were resistant to ampicillin [11]. Klebsiella spp. were detected in 51/1541 (3.3 %) equine samples. Two K. michiganensis and one K. oxytoca were identified as non-repetitive cefotaxime-resistant isolates. These three isolates were phenotypically resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [12].
Accurate identification at the species level is important for recognizing the epidemiological and clinical significance of each member of the KoC in both humans and animals. Current diagnostics are unable to consistently differentiate between members of the KoC leading to historic misidentification of non-K. oxytoca strains as K. oxytoca [10]. The phenotypic similarity of the complex members prevents accurate identification using biochemical tests such as API 20E tests [1]. While MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid and cost-effective diagnostic tool, many databases in clinical and veterinary use have not been updated and lack biomarkers required to consistently differentiate members of the KoC [13, 14]. The use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing is considered unsuitable for identifying Klebsiella at the species level as the gene sequence is so highly conserved in this taxon [15]. gyrA and rpoB gene sequences have been used to distinguish K. grimontii and K. huaxiensis from other members of the KoC, supported by results from average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis of genome sequence data [16, 17]. More recently, rpoB gene sequence analysis has been used to identify KoC, Klebsiella pneumoniae complex and Raoultella spp. isolates recovered from the faeces of healthy women and breast-fed infants [18]. MLST can also be used to assign strains to species of the KoC [10].
Bacteriophages (phages) are promising alternatives or adjuncts to current antibiotic therapies. We previously published an extensive review on Klebsiella phage and their potential as therapeutics [19]. The majority of Klebsiella phage publications focus on K. pneumoniae. Phage vB_Kox_ZX8 was isolated from human faeces; this phage was shown to clear bacteraemia caused by a clinical strain of K. oxytoca in BALB/c mice [20]. Another recent study described 30 novel phages that were active against Klebsiella species including KoC members K. oxytoca and K. michiganensis [21]. Of the phages isolated, 15 were active against the single K. michiganensis strain tested, whereas 16 showed activity against at least one of the five K. oxytoca strains tested. More recently, the lytic Drexlerviridae phage KMI8 was isolated against K. michiganensis [22]. KMI8 was lytic against 3/5 K. michiganensis strains but not K. pneumoniae (0/5) or K. oxytoca (0/1). To the best of our knowledge, ISF3 and ISF6 [23] and RP180 [24] are the only three Raoultella phages recorded in the literature. They were isolated against Raoultella ornithinolytica and Raoultella spp., respectively.
This study aimed to characterize the morphology, genomes and host ranges of two lytic phages, vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii, isolated against two strains of GES-5-encoding K. michiganensis (PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4, respectively) [25]. We used rpoB gene sequence analysis to accurately identify 108 clinical and veterinary isolates identified as K. oxytoca using MALDI-TOF MS and/or API 20E. These isolates were used in our host range analysis, to determine the therapeutic potential of vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii against Klebsiella spp. A pangenome analysis was undertaken to compare our new phage genomes with those of their closest relatives.
Methods Isolation of lytic phage Filter-sterilized sewage samples (0.45 µm pore size cellulose acetate filter; Millipore) collected from mixed-liquor tanks at Mogden Sewage Treatment Works (March 2017) were screened against K. michiganensis strains PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4 [10, 25]. Firstly, 9 ml of filter-sterilized sewage were added to 1 ml of 10×concentrated sterile nutrient broth (NB) (Oxoid) containing 50 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM MgCl2. This was then inoculated with 200 µl of overnight culture from each strain and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10 000 r.p.m. for 5 min; the supernatants were aliquoted (200 µl) and used in spot assays to identify lytic phage. Plaques were propagated to purity to create phage stocks.
Growth media and culture conditions Bacterial cultures were initially streaked onto MacConkey agar (Sigma Aldrich) to ensure purity before being grown on nutrient agar (NA) (Sigma Aldrich). NB (Sigma Aldrich) was used for overnight cultures, incubated aerobically at 37 °C. All media used for phage assays were supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 (final concentration 0.5 mM) unless otherwise specified.
Colony PCR and sequencing of rpoB gene products Forward (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAGGCGAAATGGCGGAAAACCA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCGAGTCTTCGAAGTTGTAACC-3′) rpoB-specific primers (Macrogen) [26] were diluted to 10 µM in DNase-free H2O. A single colony for each isolate was touched using a sterile loop and dipped into the PCR master mix: 25 µl MangoMix (Meridian Bioscience); forward and reverse primers (0.5 µM final concentration); 20 µl DNase-free H2O. DNA loading dye was included in the MangoMix. The positive control tube contained 2 µl of concentrated K. michiganensis PS_Koxy1 DNA [10] and the negative control contained master mix alone (no template DNA). The cycle conditions were as follows: initial denaturation, 95 °C for 10 min; 35 cycles 95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; final extension, 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were checked for single bands of expected size (1076 nt) using agarose gel electrophoresis (1 % agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer; 100 V, 40 min) against a GeneRuler 1 kb ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific).
The Thermo Scientific Gene JET PCR Purification Kit was used to clean PCR products. Purified samples were checked for DNA concentration and purity using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. Samples were then adjusted to 10 ng µl−1 and sent for sequencing (Source BioScience) using the MLST forward primer (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′) [26].
Phylogenetic analysis of rpoB gene sequences Returned rpoB gene sequences were trimmed to 501 nt using Geneious Prime (v2020.0.5) by extracting the sequence between 276 and 776 nt, and with reference to the 45 rpoB allele sequences (released 19 June 2020) available for download from the PubMLST Klebsiella oxytoca/michiganensis/grimontii/pasteurii typing database [27]. rpoB gene sequences were extracted from the following genomes and used in analyses: K. oxytoca (GCA_900977765), K. spallanzanii (GCA_901563875), K. pasteurii (GCA_901563825), K. grimontii (GCA_900200035), K. michiganensis (GCA_901556995), K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae (GCA_000826585), K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis (GCA_000163455), K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (GCA_000742135), K. quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae (GCA_900978135), K. quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae (GCA_000751755), K. africana (GCA_900978845), ‘K. quasivariicola’ (GCA_000523395), K. variicola subsp. tropica (GCA_900978675), K. variicola subsp. variicola (GCA_900977835), K. aerogenes (GCA_003417445), K. indica (GCA_005860775) and K. huaxiensis (GCA_003261575). Raoultella electrica (GCA_006711645), R. terrigena (GCA_006539725), R. planticola (GCA_000735435) and R. ornithinolytica (GCA_001598295) rpoB gene sequences were also included in analyses, as these taxa should be classified as Klebsiella spp. [28]. A multiple-sequence alignment (MSA; available as Supplementary Material, available with the online version of this article) was created using Clustal Omega (v1.2.2). The Jukes–Cantor genetic distance model was used to generate a neighbour-joining tree using the rpoB gene sequence of K. aerogenes ATCC 13048T as an outgroup. The resulting newick file (available from figshare) was exported to iTOL (v6.1.1) [29] for visualization and annotation of the phylogenetic tree.
Host range analysis Sterile molten top NA (3 ml; 0.2 % SeaPlaque Agarose, Lonza) supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 (both at 5 mM) was aliquoted into sterile test tubes held at 45 °C. Each tube was then inoculated with 250 µl of an overnight culture of the prospective host strain, and gently swirled to mix the contents before being poured onto an NA plate. The plate was gently swirled to ensure even distribution of top agar. Once set, 5 µl aliquots of both phages were spotted onto the plate (vB_KmiM-2Di, 1.67×109 pfu/ml; vB_KmiM-4Dii, 1.87×109 pfu/ml). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Next day, plates were inspected for lysis, with results recorded according to a modification of Haines et al. [30]: ++, complete lysis; +, hazy lysis; 0, no visible plaques. We also noted whether depolymerase activity (d) was evident (i.e. formation of haloes around plaques).
Phage concentration The Vivaspin 20 50 kDa centrifugal concentrator (Cytiva) was used to concentrate 20 ml of filter-sterilized propagated phage. Samples were spun at 3000 g until only 200 µl of the sample remained. This concentrated phage stock was stored at 4 °C.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Formvar/carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific) were prepared via glow discharge (10 mA, 10 s) using a Q150R ES sputter coater (Quorum Technologies). Phage suspensions (15 µl) were pipetted onto the grid surface for 30 s before removal using filter paper. Samples were stained using 15 µl of 2 % phosphotungstic acid. Excess stain was removed using filter paper and grids were air-dried. Samples were visualized using a JEOL JEM-2100Plus (JEOL) TEM and an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Images were analysed and annotated using ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Fiji).
Phage DNA extraction Nuclease-free H2O was added to 200 µl of concentrated phage for a total final volume of 450 µl. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h with 50 µl of 10×CutSmart Buffer (New England BioLabs) supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2, 10 µl of DNase I (1 U µl−1) (Thermo Scientific) and RNase A (10 mg ml−1) (Thermo Scientific). Next, 20 µl of EDTA (final concentration 20 mM) and 1.3 µl of Proteinase K (20 mg ml−1) (Qiagen) were added and incubated at 56 °C for 1.5 h. The Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract and purify the phage DNA. DNA was eluted in 20 µl of the kit’s AE buffer. Phage DNA integrity was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis (1 % agarose gel in 1×TAE buffer; 70 V, 90 min) against a GeneRuler 1 kb ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Phage DNA sequencing, genome assembly and characterisation Sequence data were generated on our in-house Illumina MiSeq platform. Extracted DNA was adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 ng/µL and treated using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina) to produce fragments of approximately 500 bp. Fragmented and indexed samples were run on the sequencer using a Micro flow cell with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina; 150 bp paired-end reads) following Illumina’s recommended denaturation and loading procedures. Quality of raw sequence data was assessed using FastQC v0.11.9. Reads had a mean phred score above 30 and contained no adapter sequences, so data were not trimmed. Genomes were assembled using SPAdes v3.13.0 (default settings) [31], and visualized using Bandage v0.8.1 [32]. Contamination and completeness of genomes were determined using CheckV v0.8.1 [33]. Paired-end sequence reads were also mapped against assembled genomes using Geneious Prime. Genomes were screened for antimicrobial resistance genes using the Resistance Gene Identifier (v5.2.0) of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (v3.1.4) [34].
ViPTree v1.9 [35] was used to determine whether the phage genomes were closely related to previously described double-stranded DNA viruses. Initial analyses showed them to be closely related to Klebsiella virus KP15 (genus Slopekvirus) [36]. Other Slopekvirus genomes were identified in GenBank and from the literature (Table 2) and included in a second ViPTree analysis. All publicly available genome sequences were also compared against the genomes of Klebsiella phage vB_KmiM-2Di and Klebsiella phage vB_KmiM-4Dii using pyani v0.2.11 (ANIm) [37].
Analysis of homing endonucleases (HENs) encoded within phage genomes Genes in all genomes included in the initial ViPTree analysis (Table 2) were predicted and annotated using Prokka 1.14.6 [38] using the PHROG [39] dataset. Data were imported into R using Biostrings v2.58.0 [40] and predicted protein names searched for ‘HNH|homing’ to identify hypothetical HENs encoded with the phage genomes. The HEN sequences were exported in fasta format and imported into Geneious Prime. An MSA was created using Clustal Omega v1.2.3 (options selected: group sequences by similarity, evaluate full distance matrix, five refinement iterations). From the MSA, a neighbour-joining tree (Jukes–Cantor) was generated. The tree was uploaded to iToL v6.4.2 [41] for annotation. All data associated with the HEN analysis are available from figshare.
Comparative genome analyses PhageClouds uses a gene-network approach to allow rapid searching of ~640 000 phage genomes via a web interface, and includes metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) derived from several large-scale metagenome and virome studies [42]. Sequences of our initial set of GenBank genomes (Table 2) were searched against the PhageClouds database to identify slopekvirus genomes not included in our original analysis, and to determine whether such genomes had been detected in metagenome/virome studies. Results from PhageClouds searches were manually checked to identify a non-redundant set of genomes potentially representing slopekviruses. Quality and completeness of the genomes were determined using CheckV. ViPTree was used to confirm the newly identified genomes fell within the genus Slopekvirus.
For all genomes found to be of high quality or complete (n=24; Table 2), VIRIDIC was used to calculate the intergenomic similarities of the virus sequences [43]. The 24 genomes were Prokka-annotated as described above and included in a pangenome analysis (Roary v3.12.0, 95 % identity [44]; . Using treeio v1.18.1 [45] and ggtree v3.2.1 [46] a phylogenetic tree was generated from the Roary-generated newick file (accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick), while the binary gene presence/absence file (gene_presence_absence.Rtab) was used to visualize the core and accessory genes identified in the slopekvirus pangenome. For each of the 24 genome sequences, nucleotide and amino acid sequences of core genes with ≥95 % nucleotide identity and ≥70 % coverage (based on comparisons of minimum, average and maximum gene group sizes determined from Roary outputs) were concatenated. These sequences were then used to generate MSAs with muscle v3.8.1551 [47]. Maximum-likelihood trees were generated from the MSAs using phyml v3.3.20180214 (BLOSUM62 for protein sequences, 100 bootstraps; Jukes−Cantor for nucleotide sequences, 100 bootstraps [48]), and visualized using iToL v6.4.2. The Prokka-annotated genomes and outputs from Roary are available from figshare.
Results Morphological and genomic characterization of phages isolated on K. michiganensis Two phages (vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii) had been isolated and purified on K. michiganensis strains PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4, respectively, during ongoing studies focussed on finding alternatives to antibiotics for treating Klebsiella-associated infections [25]. In this study, genome sequence data and TEM images were generated for both phages. The genomes were found to be of high quality and free of contamination using CheckV (Table 2): the linear genome of vB_KmiM-2Di (148×coverage) was 99.34 % complete, comprising 177 200 nt and encoding 275 genes; the linear genome of vB_KmiM-4Dii (177×coverage) was 98.02 % complete, comprising 174 857 nt and encoding 271 genes. Mapping of the sequence reads against their respective genomes showed the even coverage of reads expected for circularly permuted genomes (not shown). We did not observe paired reads from clones across the ends, further indicating that our assembled genomes were incomplete. Neither phage-encoded antimicrobial resistance genes. Initial blast-based and ViPTree analyses suggested the genomes represented members of the genus Slopekvirus (Duplodnaviria › Heunggongvirae › Uroviricota › Caudoviricetes › Straboviridae › Slopekvirus). A ViPTree analysis, incorporating all slopekvirus genomes known to us at the time of analysis, confirmed this association (Fig. 1a). vB_KmiM-2Di clustered most closely with Klebsiella virus PMBT1 and Enterobacter virus Eap3, whereas vB_KmiM-4Dii was most closely related to Klebsiella phage vB_KoM-MeTiny and Klebsiella phage vB_KoM-Pickle. ANIm analysis (Fig. 1b) showed vB_KmiM-2Di shared ≥99 % ANI with Klebsiella virus PMBT1. vB_KmiM-4Dii shared ≥99 % ANI with Escherichia phage phT4A, Klebsiella phage vB_KoM-MeTiny and Klebsiella phage vB_KoM-Pickle.
TEM images (Fig. 1c and d) showed both phages were myoviruses due to their contractile tails. Phage vB_KmiM-2Di (Fig. 1c) had a clearly visible base plate and long tail fibres. The capsid diameter was 84.1 nm (sd 3.8 nm), the tail and baseplate were 135.73 nm in length (sd 5.3 nm) and the phage had a total length of 251.6 nm (sd 11.5 nm). Phage vB_KmiM-4Dii (Fig. 1d) had a capsid diameter of 84.7 nm (sd 2 nm), its tail and baseplate were 130.9 nm in length (sd 1 nm) and the total length was 240.24 nm (sd 14.4 nm) (n=4 measurements for each phage). Three short tail fibres could be seen attached at the bottom of the base plate and short whiskers protruded from the collar under the capsid.
Identification of clinical and veterinary KoC isolates rpoB gene sequence data were generated for clinical (n=59), and veterinary (n=49) isolates previously identified as K. oxytoca using MALDI-TOF MS and API 20E tests (Table 1). Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene can be used to differentiate between members of the KoC, Klebsiella pneumoniae complex and Raoultella spp. using a single primer set. Alternative methods, such as differences in the blaOXY gene, cannot be used for differentiation of the K. pneumoniae complex or other closely related organisms such as members of the genus Raoultella [10, 17, 18].
These data were compared against the 45 rpoB reference allele sequences (released 19 June 2020) available for download from the PubMLST Klebsiella oxytoca/michiganensis/grimontii/pasteurii typing database and rpoB gene sequences of the type strains of Klebsiella (including Raoultella) spp. (Fig. S1). This was done to confirm the identity of isolates as we (and others) have previously shown that phenotypic tests and MALDI-TOF are often inadequate for characterization of KoC isolates [10].
Analysis of the sequence data revealed K. michiganensis was the most prevalent species represented in both clinical and veterinary isolates (46 % and 43 %, respectively; 27/59 clinical, 21/49 veterinary; Fig. 2a), with the rpoB gene sequences of all isolates clustering in the clade with the rpoB gene sequence of K. michiganensis W14T (Fig. S1). K. oxytoca was the second most prevalent species represented in the clinical isolates (40 %; 24/59), but only represented 6 % of veterinary isolates (3/49). K. grimontii was the second most-common bacterium among the veterinary isolates (24 %; 12/49) and third most-prevalent species in the clinical isolates (12 %; 7/59). R. ornithinolytica (12 %; 6/49), K. huaxiensis (4 %; 2/49) and R. terrigena (2 %; 1/49) were only represented in veterinary isolates. K. pneumoniae represented 2 % (1/59) of clinical isolates and 8 % (4/49) of veterinary isolates.
The majority (73 %; 36/49) of veterinary isolates were of bovine origin, isolated predominantly from milk-related samples (61 %; 30/49) (Fig. 2b). While isolates of K. grimontii (8/36), K. huaxiensis (2/36), K. oxytoca (1/36), K. pneumoniae (2/36), R. ornithinolytica (4/36) and R. terrigena (1/36) had been recovered from milk samples, the majority (44 %; 16/36) of the bovine isolates were K. michiganensis (Fig. 2c).
Host range analysis vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii were screened against clinical (n=59) and veterinary (n=49) isolates using an agar overlay method (Table 3). Phage activity against each strain was recorded as ++, complete lysis; +, hazy lysis; 0, no visible plaques. Depolymerase activity (d) was also recorded.
Both phages displayed a broad host range against clinical and veterinary isolates tested. vB_KmiM-2Di showed lytic activity against 66 % (71/108) of tested strains (78 %, 46/59 clinical and 51 %, 25/49 veterinary strains, respectively). Whereas vB_KmiM-4Dii showed lytic activity against 84 % (91/108) of strains (92 %, 54/59 clinical and 76 %, 37/49 veterinary strains, respectively). The two phages showed lytic activity against one or more strains of K. michiganensis, K. oxytoca, K. grimontii, R. ornithinolytica, K. huaxiensis and R. terrigena. Additionally, vB_KmiM-4Dii showed activity against K. pneumoniae.
The formation of haloes around plaques, indicating depolymerase activity, was observed for both phages against strains Ko13 and GFKo7. vB_KmiM-4Dii also displayed depolymerase activity against strain GFKo41. Neither vB_KmiM-2Di nor vB_KmiM-4Dii was able to infect 17 % (18/108) of the strains tested, the majority (80 %, 12/15) of which were of veterinary origin.
Analysis of HENs encoded within slopekvirus genomes It has previously been suggested that differences in host range for members of the genus Slopekvirus may be due to homing endonucleases (HENs) encoded within their genomes. These HENs may act as regulators of DNA modification and provide resistance to host restriction enzymes [49]. Fifty-four putative HENs were encoded within 13/16 Slopekvirus genomes (Fig. 3). Several genomes encoded multiple putative HENs, with Escherichia phage phT4A (NC_055712) encoding nine. vB_KmiM-2Di encoded five HENs whereas vB_KmiM-4Dii encoded four. Of these, two had possible homologues in both genomes (Fig. S2). MZ707156_00002 shared homology with MZ707157_00002; 79.7 % pairwise amino acid identity. MZ707156_00164 shared homology with MZ707157_00163; 100 % pairwise amino acid identity.
Diversity of slopekviruses in Genank and metagenomic data PhageClouds was used to identify slopekviruses not included in our initial scoping of viruses related to phages vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii. Each PhageClouds search generated 33 hits. Table S1 provides example output for a search done using the genome sequence of phage vB_KmiM-2Di. Seventeen of the 33 hits represented sequences included in our initial phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1a), six represented isolated phages not included in our initial list of viruses and 11 represented MAGs recovered from virome studies (Table 2). ViPTree analysis showed all 17 viruses were related to the genus Slopekvirus (data not shown). CheckV analysis showed four of the GenBank and four of the MAG sequences represented complete or high-quality phage genomes (Table 2).
Our initial analyses (Fig. 1, Fig. S3) showed that slopekvirus genomes shared high sequence similarity, with the HENs contributing to their diversity. Consequently, we used all 24 high-quality/complete slopekvirus genomes identified in this study (Table 2) in a pangenome analysis to determine whether core genes could be identified within the genus Slopekvirus (Fig. 4). It has been recommended that sequence and similarity coverage of proteins are set to >30 % identity and 50 % coverage, respectively, for genus-level phage-based pangenome studies [50]. However, for the genus Slopekvirus we found these criteria were too lax (not shown). Our Roary-based pangenome analysis run at 95 % identity identified 155 core genes in a total pangenome of 425 genes (Fig. 4a and b, Table S2). The pangenome was open, as the plot showing the total number of genes is not asymptotic (Fig. 4c). Filtering the core genes based on comparisons of minimum, maximum and average group nucleotide coverage (Table S2) identified 148 core genes had ≥95 % identity and ≥70 % coverage. Given that the 24 genomes encoded a mean of 272 genes (+/- 5 genes) each, these core genes represented 54 % (148/272) of the total genome content of the slopekviruses. The majority (61/148, 41 %) of these genes were predicted to encode hypothetical proteins, with baseplate wedge subunit proteins (6/148, 4 %), proteins of unknown function (4/148, 3 %), tail tube (3/148, 2 %) and RIIB lysis inhibitor, major head, head scaffolding, clamp loader of DNA polymerase, baseplate hub and 5′−3′ deoxyribonucleotidase proteins (2/148, 1 % each) making the greatest contribution to the core genes (Fig. S4). As expected, the hypothetical HENs contributed to the accessory genes.
If two phage genome sequences, tested reciprocally, are more than 95 % identical at the nucleotide level over their full genome length, they are assigned to the same species [50]. We, therefore, sought to determine the species diversity within the genus Slopekvirus. VIRIDIC analysis of the 24 genome sequences included in our pangenome analysis suggested there were eight species represented within the genus (Table S3), though bidirectional hierarchical clustering of these data showed no obvious clustering of the species (Fig. 5a). An MSA of the concatenated nucleotide sequences for the 148 core genes (available from figshare) showed the total alignment of 99, 156 nt shared a minimum identity of 96.41 % across all genomes (Table S4). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 5b) of these concatenated sequences did not support species separation, nor did clustering of the accessory gene (binary) data in the pangenome analysis (Fig. 4a). An analysis based on the concatenated amino acid sequences of the 148 core genes showed similar results (Fig. S5).
Discussion In this study we characterized the morphology and genomes of two phages (vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii) we had isolated on two strains (PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4, respectively) of multidrug-resistant K. michiganensis [10, 25]. Both phages were found to belong to the genus Slopekvirus and had the myovirus-type morphology consistent with other known slopekviruses (Fig. 1). The host ranges of these phages were determined on a collection of clinical (n=59) and veterinary (n=49) bacteria that had been originally identified as belonging to the KoC (Table 1). Both phages were found to have broad host ranges (Table 3). This feature of the slopekviruses is thought to be due to the number of HENs encoded within their genomes (Fig. 3). Searches among ~640 000 phage genomes, using PhageClouds, allowed us to identify slopekviruses within metagenome and virome datasets. We also characterized the genomes of our phages and those of their closest relatives, undertaking a pangenome analysis to better understand the genomic diversity of slopekviruses.
Identification of members of the KoC from clinical and veterinary sources Despite our clinical and veterinary isolates being presumptively identified as K. oxytoca by MALDI-TOF MS and API 20E profiling, K. oxytoca only represented 25 % (27/108) of the isolates identified by rpoB gene sequence analysis. While we have previously highlighted that phenotypic assays and MALDI-TOF MS frequently do not allow accurate identification of clinical isolates of the KoC [10, 51], this is the first time we have encountered issues identifying veterinary KoC isolates. Veterinary MALDI-TOF MS databases should be updated to include relevant reference spectra to allow differentiation of KoC species [1].
The rpoB gene-based sequence analysis identified K. michiganensis as the most common isolate from both clinical and veterinary samples (27/59 and 21/49, respectively). This supports our previous findings with respect to K. michiganensis being more clinically relevant than K. oxytoca [51]. Gómez et al. also used rpoB gene sequence analysis to identify commensal, community-acquired and neonatal intensive care unit Klebsiella spp. isolates. Routine biochemical testing identified 21 K. oxytoca; however, rpoB gene analysis identified them as K. michiganensis (16/21), K. grimontii (5/21) and K. pneumoniae (1/21) [18]. Taken together with our work, these findings reinforce the clinical relevance of K. michiganensis and its historic underappreciation as a human pathogen due to misidentification.
In recent years, K. michiganensis has been isolated from a diverse range of animals: farm animals (cows, poultry and pigs) [13, 52], companion animals (cat, dog and horses) [12, 52] and other animals including hedgehogs, guineapigs, mice, fruit bats, turtles and invertebrates [13, 52–55]. This is from using tools capable of discriminating between members of the KoC, but further work is needed to assess the true clinical and epidemiological significance of K. michiganensis in animals. Furthermore, many of these studies are retrospective, using accurate but time- and resource-intensive methods that would not be practical for rapid clinical or veterinary diagnosis. It is notable that 16/21 of our K. michiganensis veterinary isolates had been recovered from bovine milk samples (Table 1; Fig. 2c). Whether these isolates encode genetic determinants specific to mastitis, as observed for an acquired lac operon in bovine-associated K. pneumoniae [56], will be determined when we analyse genome sequence data for them in the future, with results to be reported elsewhere.
K. grimontii has previously been isolated from animals in Germany (cattle/milk, rabbit, pig, sheep, dog, pig, tortoise, hedgehog, roe deer) [13], and during a longitudinal study undertaken in Pavia, Italy (sheep, horse, fly, cattle, pig, cat, duck, turtle, dog, cockroach, wasp, chicken) [52]. We found K. grimontii in seal (n=2), bovine (n=8), gecko (n=1) and sparrow (n=1) samples collected in the UK. K. grimontii appears to be the second most-common KoC species of veterinary relevance.
K. huaxiensis was originally described based on one isolate recovered from human urine in China [16]. Since then, the bacterium has been isolated from cow and human faeces in Italy [1], and from cows (n=4), water (n=2), a horse (n=1) and hospital carriage (n=1) [52]. In this study we identified two isolates (GFKo11, GFKo50) from bovine milk collected in Scotland. As for other members of the KoC, more work is needed to determine the wider relevance of K. huaxiensis to veterinary infections.
Host range determination for phages vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii We found that phages vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii both exhibited broad host ranges against several different species of bacteria (Table 3). This includes isolates of K. pneumoniae, K. michiganensis, K. oxytoca, K. grimontii, R. ornithinolytica, K. huaxiensis and R. terrigena. Ordinarily, phage host range is narrow, sometimes down to the strain level. However broad-host-range phages are reported in the literature [57–59] and phages with extended host ranges have been identified within the genus Slopekvirus [21, 36]. For example, phage vB_KoM-MeTiny, which is genetically similar to vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii (95.2 % and 96.2 % respectively; VIRIDIC), is reported to form plaques on K. michiganensis, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. These findings suggest bacteriophage belonging to the genus Slopekvirus are useful as potential therapeutics owing to their broad host ranges and lack of antimicrobial resistance genes [21, 36], in agreement with others who have worked with slopekviruses [21, 30].
Despite a high level of sequence identity between vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii (95.25 %; VIRIDIC) differences in host range were observed between the two phages. Maciejewska et al. previously characterized two slopekviruses (vB_KpnM_KP15 and vB_KpnM_KP27) that exhibit broad lysis against Klebsiella spp. [49]. They also noted differences in the host ranges of the two phages, despite a high-level of DNA identity (94.2 %; our VIRIDIC analysis). The authors suggested the discord in host range may be due to the presence of two HENs encoded within the genome of vB_KpnM_KP27, both of which are absent from vB_KpnM_KP15. HENs are site-specific DNA endonucleases that function as mobile genetic elements by catalysing a double-strand break at specific DNA target sites in a recipient genome that lacks the endonuclease. The double-strand break is then repaired by homologous recombination using the allele containing the HEN as the template. The result is the incorporation of the HEN into the cleavage site. Maciejewska et al. hypothesized that HENs encoded within vB_KpnM_KP27 (YP_007348875.1 and YP_007348891.1) may act as regulators of DNA modification by splicing events near DNA modification genes located in their close vicinity. Such events may result in protection against host restriction enzymes and subsequently modulate host range. This could occur through alteration of genes involving nucleotide metabolism, DNA methylation or DNA restriction. We identified a homologue of YP_007348875.1 (86 % pairwise amino acid identity with MZ707157_00254) and its associated flanking region in the genome of vB_KmiM-4Dii that is absent from vB_KmiM-2Di (Fig. S6). The flanking regions invB_KmiM-4Dii are identical to those found in phage KP27 described in Maciejewska et al. This includes the upstream RNA ligase and downstream DprA-like DNA recombination-mediator protein. The second HEN identified in KP27 (YP_007348891.1) was absent from both vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii. The presence of YP_007348875.1 in the genome of vB_KmiM-4Dii may help explain its slightly broader host range compared to vB_KmiM-2Di.
We also conducted a search for other HENs encoded in other slopekvirus genomes. Despite a high degree of genetic conservation across the genus (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), there was a high level of divergence with respect to the number and type of HENs encoded across the 16 genomes and between vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii. We found that vB_KmiM-2Di encodes five hypothetical HENs, whereas vB_KmiM-4Dii encodes four. Of note was a HEN identified in the genomes of both vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii (locus tags MZ707156_00164 and MZ707157_00163, respectively; Prokka-annotated data available from figshare). This HEN was found immediately upstream of a CDS encoding a putative SbcC-like subunit of a predicted palindrome-specific endonuclease (Fig. S7). This may again be a case of a HEN splicing event near a gene involved in DNA modification. SbcC and SbcD (also present in the phage genome) are nucleases that have been shown to be involved in the degradation of palindromic DNA structures and associated hairpin structures [60].
In addition to exploring the possibility of HENs affecting the host range of the two phages, we also sought to identify differences in tail fibre proteins, which are often determinants of host-cell specificity. We examined the genomic region encoding five tail fibre proteins as identified by Maciejewska et al. [49] (Fig. S8a). Our analysis found the first three of these proteins share a high level of amino acid identity between homologues in vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii (>90 % pairwise identity). However, the fourth protein, encoding the tail fibre (predicted as an l-shaped tail fibre protein by HHPred), shares only 76.80 % pairwise amino acid identity. There was a considerable lack of conservation at the C-terminal of this protein, which is considered to be the region responsible for host-receptor recognition [61]. Additionally, the final protein of this region did not appear to be homologous between the phages (13.3 % pairwise amino acid identity). As determined by HHPred, the predicted tail fibre adhesin of vB_KmiM-2Di shows structural similarity to protein gp38 from Salmonella phage S16, which is involved in host-cell receptor recognition [62]. However, the tail fibre assembly protein of vB_KmiM-4Dii is a chaperone involved in correct folding of the tail fibre and likely trimerization [63]. Amino acid alignments for tail fibre proteins are presented inFig. S8b. These results may further explain the differences in host range observed between vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii. These findings lend support to the theory that HENs, in combination with differences in tail fibre proteins, may influence host range and contribute to the differences in host lysis observed between vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii.
It has been noted by others [21, 64] that phages with highly similar sequences may have altered lytic spectra due to selection pressures applied by different hosts used for propagation. In the current study, K. michiganensis strains PS_Koxy2 and PS_Koxy4 were used for propagation of vB_KmiM-2Di and vB_KmiM-4Dii, respectively. These two strains have been extensively characterized both genomically and phenotypically and have been shown to share >99.9 % ANI and the same multi-locus sequence type [10]. Therefore, we conclude that any differences observed with respect to host range are unlikely to be a consequence of the host used for propagation.
Genetic diversity of slopekviruses: implications for phage taxonomy Our Roary-based pangenome analysis of 24 high-quality/complete slopekvirus genomes showed the genus Slopekvirus comprises phages with highly conserved genomes, with the core genome (determined using ≥95 % identity and ≥70 % coverage) representing over half of the total genome content of the genus (Fig. 4). The recommended cut-off criteria (>30 % identity, 50 % coverage [50]) for genus-level phage pangenome analysis was found to be inappropriate for use with the genus Slopekvirus. Results from our analysis (along with other unpublished work from our laboratory) suggest wider-ranging studies are required to determine appropriate recommended identity and coverage cut-off values for use in phage-based pangenome studies at any taxonomic level.
The use of VIRIDIC (and other ANI tools) to assign phage that share ≥95 % reciprocal sequence identity at the nucleotide level over their full genome length to the same species is also questioned [50]. Our VIRIDIC analysis of 24 high-quality/complete slopekvirus genomes suggested our dataset represented eight different species (Fig. 5). However, phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of 148 core genes (encoding 99, 156 nt) did not support separation of the genus into eight species. ANI analyses must be supplemented with phylogenetic analyses to provide robust evidence to support ‘species’ designations within phage genera, as recommended for bacterial and archaeal taxonomy [65].
